.. _Historical_seismology_io:
Historical Perspective on Seismology Formats and Vestigal IO Concepts
========================================================================

The idea of this section is for it to be an appendix with my name
attached and a warning it is part essay and part educational material.

May want to start with a autobiograph8cal sketch noting my 50 yr history in computing
Key points are:
- linear files and impact on common Formats
- miniseed first format to break the linear file model
- format is not the data is a key idea of MsPASS abstractions
- modern systems have fully abstracted io complexities; a common misunderstanding of many scientists
- point to another planned new section on io that covers modern abstractions:  files on disk, files in a lustre type system, and cloud storage.
