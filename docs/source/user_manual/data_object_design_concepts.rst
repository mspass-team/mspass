Data Object Design Concepts
===========================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

| The core data objects in MsPASS were designed to encapsulate the most
  atomic objects in seismology waveform processing:  scalar (i.e. single
  channel) signals, and three-component signals.   The versions of these
  you as a user should normally interact with are two objects defined in
  MsPASS as :code:`TimeSeries` and :code:`Seismogram` respectively.  

| These data objects were designed to simply interactions with MongoDB. 
  MongoDB is completely flexible in attribute names handled by the
  database.  In all cases, the components of a data object should be conceptualized
  as four distinct components handled separately and discussed in more detail
  below:

1. The waveform data (normally the largest in size).

2. A generalization of the traditional concept of a trace header.  These
   are accessible as simple name value pairs but the value can be anything.
   It is a bit like a python dictionary, but implemented with standard C++.

3. An error logger that provides a generic mechanism to post error messages
   in a parallel processing environment.

4. An optional object-level processing history mechanism.

| Data objects are grouped in memory with a generic concept called an
  :code:`Ensemble`.   The implementation in C++ uses a template to define a
  generic ensemble.   A limitation of the current capability to link C++
  binary code with python is that templates do not translate directly.  
  Consequently, the python interface uses two different names to define
  Ensembles of TimeSeries and Seismogram objects:  :code:`TimeSeriesEnsemble`
  and :code:`SeismogramEnsemble` respectively.

| The C++ objects have wrappers for python that hide implementation details from
  the user.   All MongoDB operations implemented with the pymongo
  package use these wrappers.   Compute intensive numerical operations on the sample
  data should either be written in C/C++ with their own wrappers or
  exploit numpy/scipy numerical routines.   The later is possible
  because the wrappers make the data arrays look like numpy arrays.  

History
~~~~~~~

| It might be helpful for the user to recognize that the core data
  objects in MsPASS are the second generation of a set of data objects
  developed by one of the authors (Pavlis) over a period of more than 15
  years.   The original implementation was developed as a component of
  Antelope.  It was distributed via the open source additions to
  Antelope distributed through the `Antelope user's
  group
  <https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib>`__ and referred to as SEISPP.   The bulk of
  the original code can be found
  `here <https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/tree/master/lib/seismic/libseispp>`__
  in github, and doxygen generated pages comparable to those found with
  this package can be found
  `here <https://pavlab.sitehost.iu.edu/software/seispp/index.html>`__. 

| To design the core data objects from this older library we followed
  standard advice and mostly burned the original code keeping only the most
  generic components needed to handle concepts the authors had found essential over the
  years.   The revisions followed these guidelines:

-  Make the API as generic as possible.
-  Use inheritance more effectively to make the class structure more
   easily extended to encapsulate different variations in seismic data.
-  Divorce the API completely from Antelope to achieve the full open
   source goals of MsPASS.  Although not implemented at this time, the
   design will allow a version 2 of SEISPP in Antelope, although that is
   a "small matter of programming" that may never happen.
-  Eliminate unnecessary/extraneous constructors and methods developed
   by the authors as the class structure evolved organically over the
   years.  In short, think through the core concepts more carefully and
   treat SEISPP as a prototype.
-  Extend the Metadata object (see below) to provide support for more
   types (objects) than the lowest common denominator of floats, ints,
   strings, and booleans handled by SEISPP. 
-  Reduce the number of public attributes to make the code less prone to
   user errors.   Note the word "reduce" not "eliminate" as many books advise.
   The general rule is simple parameter type attributes are only accessible
   through getters and putters while the normally larger main data components
   are public.  That was done to improve performance and allow things like
   numpy operations on data vectors.

| MsPASS has hooks to and leans heavily on
  `obspy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`__.   We chose, however,
  to diverge some from obspy in some fundamental ways.   We found two
  fundamental flaws in obspy for large scale processing that required
  this divergence:

#. obspy handles what we call Metadata through set of python objects
   that have to be maintained separately and we think unnecessarily
   complicate the API.   We aimed instead to simplify the management of
   Metadata as much as possible.  Our goal was to make the system more like
   seismic reflection processing systems that manage the same problem
   through a simple namespace wherein metadata can be fetched with
   simple keys.   We aimed to hide any hierarchic structures (e.g
   relational database table relationships, obspy object hierarchies, 
   or MongoDB normalized data structures) behind the (python)
   :code:`Schema` object to reduce all Metadata to pure
   name:value pairs. 
#. obspy does not handle three component data in a native way, but mixes
   up the concepts we call :code:`Seismogram` and :code:`Ensemble` in to a common
   python object they define as a
   `Stream <http://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.html#obspy.core.stream.Stream>`__.  
   We would argue our model is a more logical encapsulation of the
   concepts that define these ideas. For example, a collection of single
   component data like a seismic reflection shot gather is a very different
   thing than a set of three component channels that define the output of
   three sensors at a common point in space.   Hence, we carefully
   separate :code:`TimeSeries` and :code:`Seismogram` (our name for Three-Component
   data).  We further distinguish :code:`Ensembles` of each atomic type.

Core Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview - Inheritance Relationships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The reader needs to first see the big picture of how TimeSeries and
  Seismogram objects are defined to understand the core concepts
  described in sections that follow.  We assume the reader has some
  understanding of the concepts of inheritance in object oriented
  code.   The inheritance structure is best understood as derived
  from the SEISPP prototype (see history above).  We aimed to rebranch
  and prune SEISPP  based on the experience from 15 years of development
  for SEISPP.

| The (admittedly) complicated inheritance diagrams for TimeSeries and
  Seismogram objects generated by doxygen are illustrated below
| |TimeSeries Inheritance|

| |Seismogram Inheritance|

| Notice that both CoreSeismogram and CoreTime series have a common
  inheritance from three base classes:  :code:`BasicTimeSeries`,
  :code:`BasicMetadata`, and :code:`BasicProcessingHistory`.   Python supports multiple
  inheritance and the wrappers make dynamic casting within the hierarchy
  (mostly) automatic.  e.g. a :code:`Seismogram` object can be passed directly to a
  python function that does only Metadata operations and it will be
  handled seamlessly because python does not enforce type signatures on
  functions.  CoreTimeSeries and CoreSeismogram should be thought of a
  defining core concepts independent from MsPASS.  All MsPASS specific
  components are inherited from ProcessingHistory.   ProcessingHistory
  implements two important concepts that were a design goal of MsPASS:
  (a) a mechanism to preserve the processing history of a piece of data
  to facilitate more reproducible science results, and (b) a parallel safe
  error logging mechanism.  A key point of the design of this class
  hierarchy is that future users could chose to prune
  the ProcessingHistory component and reuse CoreTimeSeries and
  CoreSeismogram to build a
  completely different framework. 

| We emphasize here that users should normally expect to only interact with
  the :code:`TimeSeries` and :code:`Seismogram` objects.  The lower levels sometimes
  but not always have python bindings.

| The remainder of this section discusses the individual components in
  the class hierarchy.

BasicTimeSeries - Base class of common data characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This base class object can be best viewed as an answer to this
questions:  What is a time series?   Our design answers this question by
saying all time series data have the following elements:

1. We define a time series as data that has a **fixed sample rate**.  
   Some people extend this definiion to arbitrary x-y data, but we view that as wrong. 
   Standard textbooks on signal processing focus exclusively on
   uniformly sampled data.  With that assumption the time of any sample
   is virtual and does not need to be stored.  Hence, the base object
   has methods to convert sample numbers to time and the inverse (time
   to sample number).

2. Data processing always requires the time series have a **finite length**.
   Hence, our definition of a time series directly supports windowed
   data of a specific length.   The getter for this attribute
   is :code:`npts()` and the setter is :code:`set_npts(int)`.  This definition does not
   preclude an extension to modern continuous data sets that are too
   large to fit in memory, but that is an extension we don't currently
   support. 

3. We assume the data has been cleaned and **lacks data gaps**.  Real
   continuous data today nearly always have gaps at a range of scale
   created by a range of possible problems that create gaps:  telemetry
   gaps, power failures, instrument failures, time tears, and with older
   instruments data gaps created by station servicing.  MsPASS has stub API
   definitions for data with gaps, but these are currently not
   implemented.   Since the main goal of MsPASS is to provide a
   framework for efficient processing of large data sets, we pass the
   job of finding and/or fixing data gaps to other packages or
   algorithms using MsPASS with a "when in doubt throw it out" approach
   to editing.   The machinery to handle gap processing exists in both
   obpsy and Antelope and provide possible path to solution for users
   needing more extensive gap processing functionality.

| BasicTimeSeries has seven internal attributes that are accessible via
  getters and (when absolutely necessary) can be set by the user with setters.
  Most are best understood from the class documentation, but one is worth
  highlighting here.  A concept we borrowed from seismic reflection is the idea
  of marking data dead or alive; a boolean concept.   There are methods to
  ask if the data are alive or dead (:code:`live()` and :code:`dead()` respectively) and
  setters to force live (:code:`set_live()`) or dead (:code:`kill()`).   An important
  thing to note is that an algorithm should always test if a data object
  is defined as live.  Some algorithms may choose to simply pass data marked
  dead along without changing or removing it from the workflow.
  Failure to test for the live condition can cause mysterious aborts when
  an algorithm attempts to process invalid data.
  
Handling Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| MsPASS uses a generalization to handle time that is the same as a
  novel method used in the original SEISPP library.   The concept can be
  thought of as a generalized, but yet simplified version of how SAC
  handles time.   The time standard is defined by an enum class in C++
  called tref which is mapped to fixed names in python.   There are
  currently two options: 

#. When tref is TimeReferenceType::Relative (TimeReferenceType.Relative
   in python) the computed times are some relatively small number from
   some well defined time mark.   The most common relative standard is
   the implicit time standard used in all seismic reflection data:  shot
   time.   SAC users will recognize this idea as the case when
   IZTYPE==IO.   Another important one used in MsPASS is an arrival time
   reference, which is a generalization of the case in SAC with
   IZTYPE==IA or ITn.  We intentionally do not limit what this standard
   actually defines as how the data are handled depends only on the
   choice of UTC versus Relative.  The ASSUMPTION is that if an
   algorithm needs to know the answer to the question, "Relative to what?", that
   detail will be defined in a Metadata attribute.
#. When tref is TimeReferenceType::UTC (TimeReferenceType.UTC in python)
   all times are assumed to be an absolute time standard defined by
   coordinated universal time (UTC).   We follow the approach used in
   Antelope and store ALL times defined as UTC with `unix epoch
   times. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`__  We use this
   simple approach for two reasons:  (1) storage (times can be stored as
   a simple double precision (64 bit float) field), and (2) efficiency
   (computing relative times is trivial compared to handling calendar
   data).   This is in contrast to obspy which require ALL start times
   (t0 in mspass data objects) be defined by a python class they call
   `UTCDateTime <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime.html#obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime>`__. 
   Since MsPASS is linked to obspy we recommend you use the UTCDateTime
   class in python if you need to convert from epoch times to one of the
   calendar structures UTCDateTime can handle.

| A more concise summary of what these two time standard mean is this: 
  active source data always use Relative time and earthquake data are
  always stored in raw form as UTC time stamps (e.g. see the SEED
  standard).  UTC is a fixed standard while Relative could have other
  meanings.

| The enum class syntax to define tref is awkward at best.  Consequently, we
  provide two convenience methods that have been wrapped for use in python as
  as well as C++ code:  (a) time_is_relative() returns true if the time base is
  relative, and (b) time_is_UTC() returns true if the time standard is UTC.

| BasicTimeSeries defines two methods to convert between these two time
  standards:  rtoa (Relative to Absolute) and ator (Absolute to
  Relative).  Be aware the library has internal checks to avoid an
  invalid conversion from relative to absolute with the rtoa() method. 
  This was done to avoid errors from trying to convert active source
  data to an absolute time standard when the true time is not well
  constrained. 

| For an expanded discussion on this topic go :ref:`here<time_standard_constraints>`.

Metadata Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| All data objects used by the MsPASS C++ library inherit a Metadata
  object.  A :code:`Metadata` object is best thought of through either of two
  concepts well known to most seismologists:  (1) headers (SAC), and (2)
  a dictionary container in python.   Both are ways to handle a general,
  modern concept of
  `metadata <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata>`__ commonly defined
  as "data that provides information about data".  Packages like SAC use
  fixed (usually binary fields) slots in an external data format to
  define a finite set of attributes with a fixed namespace.   obspy uses
  a python dictionary like container they call
  `Stats <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Stats.html>`__
  to store comparable information.   That approach allows metadata
  attributes to be extracted from a flexible container addressable by a
  key word and that can contain any valid data.   For example, a typical
  obspy script will contain a line like the following to fetch the station
  name from a Trace object :code:`d`. 

.. code-block:: python

  sta=d.Stats["station"]

| In MsPASS we use a similar concept based on Pavlis's SEISPP library
  but developed a number of years before obspy.   The Metadata
  object in MsPASS, however, has additional features not in the older
  SEISPP version.  

| The mspass::Metadata object has a container that can hold any valid
  data much like a python dictionary.   The current implementation uses
  the `any <https://theboostcpplibraries.com/boost.any>`__ library that
  is part of the widely used boost library.   In a C++ program Metadata
  can contain any data that, to quote the documentation from boost, is "copy
  constructable".  Thus Metadata acts much like a python dict using put
  and get operations within a python program.

| The flexibility of either a python dict or Metadata present a serious
  potential for unexpected results or crashes if not managed.   Any algorithm
  implemented in a lower level language like C/C++ or FORTRAN and exposed to
  python through wrappers is subject to crashing from type collisions.
  The fundamental problem is that python is relatively cavalier about type
  while both C/C++ and FORTRAN are "strongly typed".  MongoDB storage of attributes
  can be treated as dogmatic or agnostic about type depending on what
  language API is used.  In MsPASS all database operations are currently done
  through python, so Metadata or python dict data can be saved and restored
  seamlessly with little concern about enforcing the type of an attribute.
  Problems arise when data loaded as Metadata from MongoDB are passed to
  algorithms that demand an attribute have a particular type that is not,
  in fact, the type python guessed or received from storage in MongoDB.
  Consider this example:

.. code-block:: python

  d={'time':10}
  type(d['time'])

| The interpreter will respond to the second line with:  <class 'int'>.
  If a program wanted to use the time attribute and expected a real number
  it may crash or produce unexpected results.

| In designing MsPASS we were faced with how to cleanly manage this mismatch
  in language behavior without being too heavy handed and end up making
  a framework that was too ponderous to use? Our design sets these requirements:

*  Within an individual application managing the namespace of attributes
   and type associations should be as flexible as possible to facilitate
   adapting legacy code to MsPASS.   We provide a flexible aliasing method to
   map between attribute namespaces to make this possible.  Any such application,
   however, must exercise care in any alias mapping to avoid type mismatch.
   We expect such mapping would normally be done in python wrappers.

*  Attributes stored in the database should have predictable types whenever
   possible.   We use a python class called Schema described below
   to manage the attribute namespace is a way that is not especially heavy handed.
   Details are given below when we discuss the database readers and writers.

*  Care with type is most important in interactions with C/C++ and FORTRAN
   implementations.   Pure python code can be pretty loose on type at the
   cost of efficiency.   Python is thus the language of choice for working
   out a prototype, but when bottlenecks are found key sections may need to
   be implemented in a compiled language.  In that case, the Schema rules
   provide a sanity check to reduce the odds of problems with type mismatches.

| The MsPASS C++ api for Metadata has methods that are dogmatic about type
  and methods that can take anything.  Core support is provided for
  types supported by all database engines:  real numbers (float or
  double), integers (32 or 64 bit), strings (currently assumed to be
  UTF-8), and booleans.  These functions are dogmatic and strongly
  enforce type throwing a MsPASSError exception if there is a mismatch.

| There are four strongly-typed "getters" seen in the following
  contrived code segment:

.. code-block:: python

   # Assume d is a Seismogram or TimeSeries which automatically casts to a Metadata in the python API use here
   x=d.get_double("t0_shift")   # example fetching a floating point number - here a time shift
   n=d.get_int("evid")   # example feching integer - here an event id
   s=d.get_string("sta")  # example fetching a UTF-8 string
   b=d.get_bool("LPSPOL") # boolean for positive polarity used in SAC

| There are comparable, strongly-typed "putters":

.. code-block:: python

   d.put_double("t0_shift",x)
   d.put_int("evid",n)
   d.put_string("sta",s)
   d.put_bool("LPSPOL",True)

| A more flexible although potentially more dangerous element of the API
  are generic getters and setters that will take any valid python object.
  For example, if the variable "name_list" below was a python list of
  something like seismic station names one can use this construct:

.. code-block:: python

   d.put("names",name_list)
   # or using a decorator defined in MsPASS
   d["names"]=name_list

| We can then retrieve that list with the inverse

.. code-block:: python

   x=d.get("names")
   # or using a decorator defined in MsPASS
   x=d["names"]

| A basic rule is to use the strongly typed API for attributes needed by
  algorithms implemented in compiled languages and use generic object
  attributes with care.

| An important footnote to this section is that a :code:`mspass::utility::Metadata` object
  can be constructed directly from a python dict.   That is used, for example,
  in MongoDB database readers because a MongoDB "document" is returned as a
  python dict in MongoDB's python API.

Managing Metadata type with mspasspy.db.Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Most type enforcement is imposed by data readers and writers where
  the :code:`Schema` class is automatically loaded with the :code:`Database` class
  that acts as a handle to interact with MongoDB.  Here we only document
  methods available in the :code:`Schema` class and discuss how these
  can be used in developing a workflow with MsPASS.

| The most important implementation of :code:`Schema` is a subclass with the
  name :code:`MetadataSchema`.  You can create an instance easily like this:

  .. code-block:: python

     from mspasspy.db.schema import MetadataSchema
      schema=MetadataSchema()

| :code:`MetadataSchema` currently has two main definitions that can be extracted
  from the class as follows:

  .. code-block:: python

      mdseis=schema.Seismogram
       mdts=schema.TimeSeries


| There are minor variations in the namespace between these two definitions,
  but the restrictions they impose can be interogated through a common
  interface.   Both the :code:`mdseis` and :code:`mdts` symbols above are instances of
  a the :code:`MDSchemaDefinition` class described here_.

  .. _here: ../python_api/mspasspy.db.html#module-mspasspy.db.schema

| The key point for this introduction is that the :code:`mdseis` and :code:`mdts`
  objects contain methods that can be used to get a list of restricted symbols
  (the :code:`keys()` method), the type that the framework expects that symbol
  to define (the :code:`type()` method), and a set of other utility methods.

| One subset of the methods of the MDSchemaDefinitions class that deserves
  particular discussion is a set of methods designed to handle aliases.
  These methods exist to simplify the support in the framework for adapting
  other packages that use a different set of names to define a common
  concept.   For example, although at this writing we haven't attempted this
  the design was intended to support things like automatic mapping of
  MsPASS names to and from SAC header names.  We expect similar capabilities
  should be make it feasible to map CSS3.0 attributes (e.g. Antelope's Datascope
  database implementation uses the CSS3.0 schema) loaded from relational
  database joins directly into the MsPASS namespace.  The methods used to
  handle aliases are readily apparent from the documentation page linked
  above as they all contain the keyword :code:`alias`.  We leave the exercise
  of understanding how to use this feature to planned tutorials.

Scalar versus 3C data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| MsPASS currently supports two different atomic data objects:   TimeSeries objects are
  used to store single channel data while Seismogram objects are used to store
  data from three component instruments.  TimeSeries objects are based
  on the standard concept for storing scalar data that has been around
  since the earliest days of digital seismic data in the oil and gas
  industry.  That is, the sample values are stored in a continuous block
  of memory that can be treated mathematically as a vector.   The index for the
  vector serves as a proxy for time (the :code:`time` method in BasicTimeSeries
  can be used to convert an index to a time defined as a double).  Note in mspass
  the integer index always uses the C convention starting at 0 and not 1 as in FORTRAN,
  linear algebra, and many signal processing books.
  We use a C++ `standard template library vector
  container <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/>`__ to
  hold the sample data accessible through the public variable s in the C++ api.  The
  python API makes the vector container look like a numpy array that can
  be accessed in same way sample data are handled in an obspy Trace
  object in the "data" array.   It is important to note that the C++ s vector is
  mapped to :code:`data` in the python API.   The direct interface through numpy/scipy
  allows one to manipulate sample data with numpy or scipy functions (e.g. `simple bandpass
  filters <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.iirfilter.html#scipy.signal.iirfilter>`__). 
  That can be useful for testing and prototyping but converting and algorithm
  to a parallel form requires additional steps described here (LINK to parallel
  section)

| Although scalar time series data are treated the same (i.e. as a
  vector) in every seismic processing system we are aware of, the
  handling of three component data is not at all standardized.   There
  are several reasons for this created by some practical data issues:

*   Most modern seismic reflection systems provide some support for
   three-component data.   In reflection processing scalar, multichannel
   raw data are often treated conceptually as a matrix with one array
   dimension defining the time variable and the other index defined by
   the channel number. When three component data are recorded the
   component orientation can be defined implicitly by a component index
   number.   A 3C shot gather than can be indexed conveniently with
   three array indexes.  A complication in that approach is that which
   index is used for which of the three concept required for a gather of
   3C data is not standarized.   Furthermore, for a generic system
   like mspass the multichannel model does not map cleanly into passive
   array data because a collection of 3C seismograms may have irregular
   size, may have variable sample rates,  and may come from variable
   instrumentation.  Hence, a simple matrix or array model would be very
   limiting and is known to create some cumbersome constructs.
*  Traditional multichannel data processing emerged from a
   world were instruments used synchronous time sampling.  
   Seismic reflection processing always assumes during processing that
   time computed from sample numbers is accurate to within one sample.  
   Furthermore, the stock assumption is that all data have sample 0 at
   shot time.  That assumption is a necessary condition
   for the conceptual model of a matrix as a mathematical representation
   of scalar, multichannel data to be valid.  That assumption is not necessarily
   true (in fact it is extremely restrictive if is required)
   in passive array data and raw processing requires efforts to make
   sure the time of all samples can be computed accurately and time
   aligned.  Alignment for a single station is normally automatic
   although some instruments have measurable, constant phase lags at the
   single sample level.  The bigger issue for all modern data is that
   the raw data are rarely stored in a multiplexed multichannel format,
   although the SEED format allows that.   Most passive array data
   streams have multiple channels stored as compressed miniSEED packets
   that have to be unpacked and inserted into something like a vector
   container to be handled easily by a processing program.   The process
   becomes more complicated for three-component data because at least
   three channels have to be manipulated and time aligned.   The obspy
   package handles this issue by defining a Stream object that is a
   container of single channel Trace objects.  They handle three
   component data as Stream objects with exactly three members in the
   container.  

| We handle three component data in MsPASS by using a matrix to store the data
  for a given :code:`Seismogram`.   The data are directly accessible in C++ through a public
  variable called u that is mnemonic for the standard symbol used in the
  old testament of seismology by Aki and Richards.  In python we use the
  symbol :code:`data` for consistency with TimeSeries.
  There are two choices of the order of indices for this matrix. 
  The MsPASS implementation makes this choice:  a :code:`Seismogram`
  defines index 0(1) as the channel number and index 1(2) as the time
  index.  The following python code section illustrates this more
  clearly than any words:

.. code-block:: python

   from mspasspy.ccore.seismic import Seismogram
   d = Seismogram(100)  # Create an empty Seismogram with storage for 100 time steps initialized to all zeros
   d.data[0,50] = 1.0   # Create a delta function at time t0+dt*50 in component 0

| Note as with scalar data we use the C (and python) convention for indexing starting at 0.  
  In the C++ API the matrix is defined with a lightweight
  implementation of a matrix as the data object.   That detail is
  largely irrelevant to python programmers as the matrix is made to act like
  a numpy matrix by the wrappers.   Hence, python programmers
  familiar with numpy can manipulate the :code:`data` matrix with all
  the tools of numpy noting that the data are in what numpy calls FORTRAN order. 
| The Seismogram object has a minimal set of methods that the authors
  consider core concepts defining a three component seismogram.  We
  limit these to coordinate transformations of the components.   There
  are multiple methods for rotation of the components (overloaded rotate
  method), restoring data to cardinal directions at the instrument
  (rotate_to_standard), Kennett's free surface transformation, and a
  general transformation matrix.   We use a pair of (public) boolean
  variables that are helpful for efficiency: 
  :code:`components_are_orthogonal` is true after any sequence of orthogonal
  transformations and :code:`components_are_cardinal` is true when the
  components are in the standard ENZ directions.  

  The process of creating a Seismogram from a set of TimeSeries objects
  in a robust way is not trivial. Real data issues create a great deal of
  complexity to that conversion process.  Issues include: (a) data with
  a bad channel that have to be discarded, (b) stations with multiple
  sensors that have to be sorted out, (c) stations with multiple sample
  rates (nearly universal with modern data) that cannot be merged, (d) data
  gaps that render one or more components of the set incomplete, and
  (e) others we haven't remembered or which will appear with some future
  instrumentation.   To handle this problem we have a module in MsPASS
  called :code:`bundle` documented here(THIS NEEDS A LINK - wrote this when bundle
  had not yet been merged).

| Ensembles of TimeSeries and Seismogram data are handled internally with a more
  elaborate C++ standard template library container.   For readers familiar
  with C++ the generic definition of an Ensemble is the following class

   }

| where we omit all standard constuctors and methods to focus on the key
  issues here.  First, an Ensemble should be thought of as a vector of data
  objects with a Metadata object to store attributes common to the
  entire ensemble.  Hence, the idea is to store global attributes in the
  Ensemble Metadata field.  
  The vector container makes it simple to
  handle an entire group (Ensemble) with a simple loop.   e.g. here is a
  simple loop to work through an entire Ensemble (defined in this code
  segment with the symbol d) in order of the vector index:

.. code-block:: python

   n=d.member.size()
   for i in range(n):
     somefunction(d.member[i])    # pass member i to somefunction

The wrappers also make the ensemble members "iterable".  Hence the above
block could also be written:

.. code-block:: python

   for x in d.member:
     somefunction(x)   

ProcessingHistory and Error Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Core versus Top-level Data Objects
------------------------------------

| The class hierarchy diagrams above illustrate the relationship of what
  we call CoreTimeSeries and CoreSeismogram objects to those we
  call TimeSeries and Seismogram respectively.   That
  design was aimed to make the Core objects more
  readily extendible to other uses than MsPASS.   We encourage users to
  consider using the core objects as base classes for other ways of handling
  any kind of time series data that match the concepts defined above.  

| The primary distinction between CoreTimeSeries and CoreSeismogram and their
  higher level representation as TimeSeries and Seismogram is the addition
  of two additional classes that implement two different fundamental, but
  auxiliar concepts:  (1) processing history and (2) error logging.
  The motivation for these two concepts was discussed above.  Here we
  focus on the data structure they impose.   Other sections expand on
  the details of both classes.

|  Both :code:`TimeSeries` and :code:`Seismogram` objects extend their
   "core" parents by adding two classes:

#. :code:`ProcessingHistory`, as the name implies, can (optionally) store the
   a complete record of the chain of processing steps applied to a
   data object to put it in it's current state.   The complete history has
   two completely different components described in more detail elsewhere
   in this User's Manual:
   (a) global job information designed to allow extracting the full
   instance of the job stream under which a given data object was produced,
   and (b) a chain of parent waveforms and algorithms that modified them
   to get the data in the current state.  Maintaining processing history
   is a complicated process that can lead to memory bloat in complex processing
   if not managed carefully.  For this reason this feature is off by default.
   Our design objective was to treat object level history as a final
   step to create a reproducible final product.  That would be most
   appropriate for published data to provide a mechanism for others to
   reproduce your work, archival data to allow you or others in your
   group to start up where you left off, or just for a temporary
   archive to preserve what you did.

#. :code:`ErrorLogger` is an error logging object.   The purpose of the
   error logger is to maintain a log of any errors or informative messages
   created during the processing of the data.  All processing modules
   in MsPASS are designed with global error handlers so that they should never
   abort, but in worst case post a log message that tags a fatal
   error.   (Note if any properly structured mspass enabled
   processing function throws an exception and aborts it has
   encountered a bug that needs to b reported to the authors.)
   In our design we considered making the ErrorLogger a base class
   for Seismogram and TimeSeries, but it does not satisfy the basic rule of
   making a concept a base class if the child "is a" ErrorLogger.
   It does, however, perfectly satisfy the idea that the object "has an"
   ErrorLogger.  Both :code:`TimeSeries` and :code:`Seismogram` use the
   symbol :code:`elog` as the name for the ErrorLogger object
   (e.g. If *d* is a :code:`Seismogram` object, *d.elog*, would refer to
   the error logger component of *d*.)''

Object Level History Design Concepts
---------------------------------------

As summarized above the concept we wanted to capture in the history mechanism
was a means to preserve the chain of processing events that were applied to
get a piece of data in a current state.  Our design assumes the
history can be described by an inverted tree structure.  That is, most workflows would
merge many pieces of data (a reduce operation in map-reduce) to produce
a given output.  The process chain could then be viewed as tree growth with time
running backward.  The leaves are the data sources.  Each growth season is one
processing stage.  As time moves forward the tree shrinks from many branches to
a single trunk that is the current data state.   The structure we use, however,
is more flexible than real tree growth.   Many-to-many mixes of data will produce
a tree that does not look at all like the plant forms of nature, but we hope
the notion of growth seasons, branch, and trees is useful to help understand
how this works.

To reconstruct the steps applied to data to produce an output the
following foundational data is required:

#. We need to associate the top of the inverted tree (the leaves) that are the
   parent data to the workflow.  For seismic data that means the parent time
   series data extracted from a data center with web services or assembled and
   indexed on local, random access (i.e. MsPASS knows nothing about magnetic
   tapes) storage media.

#. MsPASS assumes all algorithms can be reduced to the equivalent of an
   abstraction of a function call.  We assume the algorithm takes input data of one
   standard type and emits data of the same or different standard type. ("type"
   in this context means TimeSeries, Seismogram, or an obspy Trace object)
   The history mechanism is designed to preserve what the primary input and output
   types are.

#. Most algorithms have one to a large number of tunable parameters that
   determine their behavior.  The history needs to preserve the full
   parametric information to reproduce the original behavior.

#. The same algorithm may be run with different parameters and behave very
   differently (e.g. a bandpass filter with different
   passbands).  The history mechanism needs to distinguish these different
   instances while linking them to the same parent processing algorithm.

#. Some algorithms (e.g. what is commonly called a stacker in seismic reflection
   processing) merge many pieces of data to produce one or more outputs.  A
   CMP stacker, for example, would take an array of normal moveout corrected
   data and average them sample-by-sample to produce one output for each
   gather passed to the processor.  This is a many to one reducer.  There are
   more complicate examples like the plane wave decomposition both Wang and
   Pavlis developed in the mid 2010s.  That algorithm takes
   full event gathers, which for USArray could have thousands of seismograms,
   as inputs, and produces an output of many seismograms that are
   approximate plane wave components at a set of "pseudostation" points.
   The details of that algorithm are not the point, but it is a type example
   of a reducer that is a many-to-many operation.   The history mechanism
   must be able to describe all forms of input and output from one-to-one
   to many-to-many.

#. Data have an origin that is assumed to be reproducible (e.g. download
   from a data center) but during processing intermediate results are
   by definition volatile.   Intermediate saves of final results need to be defined
   by some mechanism to show the result were saved at that stage.  The
   final result needs a way to verify it was successfully saved to storage.

#. Although saving intermediate results is frequently necessary, the process of saving the
   data must not break the full history chain.
#. The history mechanism must work for any normal logical branching and looping
   scenario possible with a python script.

#. Naive preservation of history data could cause a huge overload in memory
   usage and processing time.  The design then needs to make the implementation
   as lightweight in memory and computational overhead as possible.  The
   implementation needs to minimize memory usage as some algorithms
   require other inputs that are not small.  Notably, the API was designd to support
   input that could be described by any python class. The a key concept is that our
   definition of "parameters" is broader than just a set of numbers.  It means
   any data that is not one of the atomic types (currently TimeSeries and Seismogram
   objects) is considered a parameter.
#. A more subtle feature of the schedules supported in MsPASS for
   parallel processing is that data objects need to be serializable.
   For python programmers that is synonymous with "pickleable".
   The most common G-tree algorithms we know of use linked lists of pointers
   to store the information we use describe object-level history.
   A different mechanism is needed that is an implementation detail
   described in the detailed section on :code:`ProcessingHistory`.

| The above is admittedly a long list of functional requirements.  Our
  ProcessingHistory object achieves those requirements with two important
  costs:  (1)  it adds a nontrivial overhead that at the time of this writing
  is not known, and (2) any algorithm that aims to preserve processing history
  needs to obey some rules and work in the social environment of the
  MsPASS framework.   MsPASS supported algorithms all implement history preservation
  as an option.   User's interested in adapting their own code to the
  framework will need to learn the social norms (i.e. the API for ProcessingHistory
  and how it can be used to automate the process).   We expect to eventually
  produce a document on adapting algorithms to MsPASS that will cover this
  subject. **Needs a link to a related document on ProcessingHistory API**

Error Logging Concepts
-------------------------

| When processing large volumes of data, errors are inevitable and
  handling them cleanly is an essential part of any processing
  framework.   This is particularly challenging with a system like Spark or Dask
  where a data set gets fragmented and handled by many
  processors.   A poorly designed error handling system could abort an
  entire workflow if one function on one piece of data threw some kinds
  of "fatal" errors.  

| To handle this problem MsPASS uses a novel :code:`ErrorLogger` object.  Any
  data processing module in MsPASS should NEVER exit on any error
  condition except one from which the operating system cannot recover. 
  (e.g. a disk write error or memory allocation error)
  All C++ and python processing modules need to have appropriate error
  handlers (i.e. try/catch in C++ and raise/except in python) to keep a
  single error from prematurely killing a large processing job.   We
  recommend all error handlers in processing functions post a message
  that can help debug the error.   Error messages should be registered
  with the data object's elog object.   Error messages should not
  normally be just posted to stdout (i.e. print in python) for two
  reasons.  First, stream io is not thread safe and garbled output is
  nearly guaranteed unless the log message are rare.  Second, with a
  large dataset it can become a nearly impossible to find out which
  pieces of data created the errors.  Proper application of the
  :code:`ErrorLogger` object will eliminate both of these problems.

| Multiple methods are available to post errors of severity from fatal
  to logging messages that do not necessarily indicate an error.   A
  small python code segment may illustrate this more clearly.

.. code-block:: python

  try:
    d.rotate_to_standard()
    d.elog.log_verbose(alg,"rotate_to_standard succeed for me")
    # ...
  except MsPASSError as err:
    d.elog.log_error(d.job_id(),alg,err)
    d.kill()  

| To understand the code above assume the symbol d is a :code:`Seismogram`
  object with a singular transformation matrix created, for example, by
  incorrectly building the object with two redundant east-west
  components.   The rotate_to_standard method tries to compute a matrix
  inverse of the transformation matrix, which will generate an
  exception of type MsPASSError (the primary exception class for MsPASSS).  
  This example catches that exception with the expected type and passes it
  directly to the ErrorLogger (:code:`d.elog`).  This form is correct because it
  is documented that that is the only class exception the function will throw.
  For more ambiguous cases we refer to multiple books and online sources
  for best practices in python programming.  The key point is in more
  ambiguous cases the construct should catch the standard base
  class :code:`Exception` as a more generic handler.  Finally, both calls to elog
  methods contain additional parameters to tag the messages.  :code:`alg` is an
  algorithm name and :code:`d.job_id()` retrieves the :code:`job_id`.  Both are
  global attributes handled through the global history management
  system described in more detail in a separate section of this manual.
| All the above would be useless baggage except the MongoDB database writers
  (Create and Update in CRUD) automatically save any elog entries in a
  separate database collection called elog.   The saved messages can be
  linked back to the data with which they are associated through the
  ObjectID of the data in the wf collection.  Details of that association
  are given in other sections of this manual.
