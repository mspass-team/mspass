This is a pair of python test scripts to validate wrappers and the 
new obspy2mspass converter.   Data files required to run these scripts
are also in this directory.   This set of files need to be moved elsewhere
(probably to tests) but I don't know how to do that and mesh with the
build system. Hence, I'm posting these now for Ian to sort out.  

When this is resolved, use git rm to delete this file.
