    Convert an obspy Stream object with 3 components to a mspass::Seismogram
    (three-component data) object.  This implementation actually converts
    each component first to a TimeSeries and then calls a C++ function to
    assemble the complete Seismogram.   This has some inefficiencies, but
    the assumption is this function is called early on in a processing chain
    to build a raw data set.

    st - input obspy Stream object.  The object MUST have exactly 3 components
        or the function will throw a AssertionError exception.  The program is
        less dogmatic about start times and number of samples as these are
        handled by the C++ function this python script calls.  Be warned,
        however, that the C++ function can throw a MsPASSrror exception that
        should be handled separately.
    mdef - global metadata catalog.   Used to guarantee all names used are registered.
    mdother - This function always loads obspy required attributes and passes the directly to the mspass
        TimeSeries object..  For each entry in mdother the procedure tries to fetch that attribute.  It's type
        is then extracted from the MetadataDefinitions object and saved with the same key.
        (default is an empty list)   Must contain azimuth and dip keys (as passed)

    aliases - is a list of attributes that should be posted to output with an alias name.  Aliases have

    master - a Seismogram is an assembly of three channels composed created from
        three TimeSeries/Trace objects.   Each component may have different
        metadata (e.g. orientation data) and common metadata (e.g. station
        coordinates).   To assemble a Seismogram a decision has to be made on
        which component has the definitive common metadata.   We use a simple
        algorithm and clone the data from one component defined by this index.
        Must be 0,1, or 2 or the function wil throw a RuntimeError.  Default is 0.
    cardinal - boolean used to define one of two algorithms used to assemble the
        bundle.  When true the three input components are assumed to be in
        cardinal directions (x1=positive east, x2=positive north, and x3=positive up)
        AND in a fixed order of E,N,Z. Otherwise the Metadata fetched with
        the azimuth and dip keys are used for orientation.
    azimuth - defines the Metadata key used to fetch the azimuth angle
       used to define the orientation of each component Trace object.
       Default is 'azimuth' used by obspy.   Note azimuth=hang in css3.0.
       Cannot be aliased - must be present in obspy Stats unless cardinal is true
    dip - defines the Metadata key used to fetch the vertical angle orientation
        of each data component.  Vertical angle (vang in css3.0) is exactly
        the same as theta in spherical coordinates.  Default is obspy 'dip'
        key. Cannot be aliased - must be defined in obspy Stats unless
        cardinal is true

    Can throw either an AssertionError or MsPASSrror(currently defaulted to
    pybind11's default RuntimeError.  Error message can be obtained by
    calling the what method of RuntimeError).
