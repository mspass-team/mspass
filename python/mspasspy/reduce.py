    This function implements a convenient foldby method for a spark RDD to generate ensembles from atomic data.
    The concept is to assemble ensembles of :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` or
    :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram` objects with a common Metadata attribute using
    a single key.  The output is the ensemble objects we call class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeriesEnsemble`
    and :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.SeismogramEnsemble` respectively.  Note that "foldby" in this context
    acts a bit like a reduce operator BUT the data volume is not reduced;  we just bundle groups of
    related data into ensembles.   The outputs are always larger due to the overhead of the ensemble
    container.   That is important as be careful with this operator as it can easily create huge
    ensembles that could cause a memory fault in your workflow.

    Note that because this is implemented as a method of the RDD class the usage is a different from
    the map and reduce methods.  arg0 is "self" which means it must be defined by the input RDD.

      # preceded by set of map-reduce lines to create RDD mydata
