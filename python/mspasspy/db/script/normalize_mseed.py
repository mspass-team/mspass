"""
This file contains a python script that defines a command line
tool we call normalize_mseed.   It is intended to be a used as a 
preprocessing tool to "normalize" the contents of the wf_miniseed 
collection.   The idea of the tool is that miniseed data, by
definition (the mini of miniseed means part of the see format) is 
incomplete and lacks station metadata.   The only thing miniseed 
data have are the four seed station code strings (net,sta, chan, and loc)
and time tags for each data packet.   The wf_miniseed collection is 
used to produce an index into a set of miniseed files that are 
presumed to define a set of waveform time segments.  This tool 
will try to create the entries channel_id and (optionally) site_id 
for each record in wf_miniseed.   It issues a report to stdout 
on completion that give the number of documents set and the number 
of documents for which no match could be found in the channel (or site)
collections.

usage: python normalize_mseed.py dbname [--normalize_site --blocksize n -wfquery querystring]
