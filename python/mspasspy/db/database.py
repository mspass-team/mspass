class Database(pymongo.database.Database):
    """
    MsPASS core database handle.  All MongoDB database operation in MsPASS
    should normally utilize this object.  This object is a subclass of the
    Database class of pymongo.  It extends the class in several ways
    fundamental to the MsPASS framework:

    1. It abstracts read and write operations for seismic data managed
       by the framework.   Note reads and writes are for atomic objects.
       Use the distributed read and write functions for parallel handling of
       complete data sets.
    2. It contains methods for managing the most common seismic Metadata
       (namely source and receiver geometry and receiver response data).
    3. It adds a schema that can (optionally) be used to enforce type
       requirements and/or provide aliasing.
    4. Manages error logging data.
    5. Manages (optional) processing history data

    The class currently has only one constructor normally called with
    a variant of the following:
      db=Database(dbclient,'mydatabase')
    where dbclient is either a MongoDB database client instance or
    (recommended) the MsPASS DBClient wrapper (a subclass of the
    pymongo client).  The second argument is the database "name"
    passed to the MongoDB server that defines your working database.

    The constructor should normally be used only with serial workflows.
    In cluster environments the recommended way to obtain a
    Database handle is via the DBClient method called `get_database`.
    The typical construct is:

        dbclient = DBClient("dbhostname")
        db = dbclient.get_database("mydatabase")

    where `dbhostname` is the hostname of the node running the MongoDB
    server and `mydatabase` is the name you assign your database.
    Serial workflows can and should use a similar construct but can
    normally default construct DBClient.

    Optional parameters are:

    :param schema: a :class:`str` of the yaml file name that defines
      both the database schema and the metadata schema. If this parameter
      is set, it will override the following two.
    :param db_schema: Set the name for the database schema to use with this
      handle.  Default is the MsPASS schema. (See User's Manual for details)
    :param md_schema:  Set the name for the Metadata schema.   Default is
      the MsPASS definitions.  (see User's Manual for details)

    As a subclass of pymongo Database the constructor accepts any
    parameters defined for the base class (see pymongo documentation)

        Top-level MsPASS reader for seismic waveform data objects.

        Most MsPASS processing scripts use this method directly
        or indirectly via the parallel version called
        `read_distributed_data`.  This function will return
        one of four seismic data objects defined in MsPASS:
        `TimeSeries`,`Seismogram`, `TimeSeriesEnsemble`, or `SeismogramEnsemble`.
        What is retrieved is driven by the type of arg0, which in the
        implementation has the symbol `id_doc_or_cursor`.  As the symbol
        name implies it can be one of three things.  Each of the three
        types have implied assumptions:

        1.  If arg0 is a MongoDB `ObjectId` it is presumed to be the ObjectId
            of a document in the collection defined by the `collection`
            argument (see below).  When used in this way a query is
            always required to retrieve the document needed to construct
            the desired datum.  This method always implies you want to
            construct one, atomic datum.  This functionality is not
            recommended as it is the slowest reader due to the implicit
            database query required to implement that approach.
        2.  If arg0 is a python dictionary (dict) it is assumed to be a
            MongoDB "document" retrieved previously through the pymongo
            interface.  This usage is the best use for serial jobs driven
            by a for loop over a MongoDB cursor returned following a find
            query.   (See User's manual and tutorials for specific examples)
            The reason is that a cursor is effectively a buffered interface
            into the MongoDB database.  That is a loop over a cursor
            requires communication with the MongoDB server only when the
            buffer drains to a low water mark.   Consequently, cursor
            loops using this interface are much faster than atomic
            reads with ObjectIds.
        3.  If arg0 is a pymongo `Cursor` object the reader assumes you are
            asking it to construct an ensemble object.  Whether that is a
            `TimeSeriesEnsemble` or `SeismogramEnsemble` is dependent upon the
            setting of the "collection" argument.  The entire content of the
            implied list of documents returned by iterating over the cursor
            are used to construct ensembles of the atomic members.  In fact,
            the basic algorithm is to call this method recursively by
            sequentially reading one document at a time, constructing the
            atomic datum, and posting it to the member vector of the ensemble.

        As noted above arg0 interacts with the "collection" argument.
        The default of "wf_TimeSeries" can be used where appropriate but
        good practice is to be explicit and specify a value for "collection"
        in all alls to this method.

        This reader accepts data in any mix of what are defined by
        the database attribute tags `storage_mode` and `format`.   If those
        attributes are not defined for a retrieved document they default to
        "storage_mode"=="gridfs" and "format"=="binary".  The `storage_mode`
        attribute can currently be one of the following:
        - `gridfs` is taken to mean the data are stored in the MongoDB
           gridfs file system.
        - 'files' implies the data are stored in conventional computer files
          stored with two attributes that are required with this storage
          mode:  "dir" and "dfile".
        - `URL` implies the data can be retrieved by some form of web service
          request through a url defined by other attributes in the document.
          This mode is volatile and currently not recommended due to the very
          slow and unreliable response to FDSN data queries.  It is likely,
          however, to become a major component with FDSN services moving to
          cloud systems.
        - This reader has prototype support for reading SCEC data stored on
          AWS s3.   The two valid values for defining those "storage_mode"s
          are "s3_continuous" and "s3_event", which map to two different
          areas of SCEC's storage on AWS.   We emphasize the readers for
          this storage mode are prototypes and subject to change.  A similar
          interface may evolve for handling FDSN cloud data storage depending
          on how that interface is actually implemented.  It was in development
          at the time this docstring was written.

        The reader can read data in multiple formats. The actual format
        expected is driven by the database attribute called "format".
        As noted above it defaults to "binary", which means the data are
        stored in contiguous binary blocks on files that can be read with
        the low-level C function fread.   That is the fastest reader
        currently available, but comes at storage cast as the data are
        uncompressed doubles.  If the data are in some nonnative format
        (seed is considered not native), the format is cracked using
        obspy.   The list of formats accepted match those defined for
        obspy's `read` function.   The format value stored in the database
        is passed as the format argument to that function.  The miniseed
        format reader has been heavily exercised.  Other formats will be
        an adventure.  Be aware there will most definitely be namespace
        collisions of Metadata attributes with non-native formats other than
        miniseed.

        There is a special case for working with ensemble data that can
        be expected to provide the highest performance with a conventional
        file system.  That is the case of ensembles with the format of
        "binary" and data saved in files where all the waveforms of each
        ensemble are in the same file.  That structure is the default for
        ensembles saved to files with the `save_data` method.  This method
        is fast because the sample data are read with a C++ function that
        uses the stock fread function that for conventional file input is
        about as fast a reader as possible.

        An additional critical parameter is "mode".  It must be one of
        "promiscuous", "cautious", or "pedantic".   Default is "promiscuous"
        which more-or-less ignores the schema and loads the entire content
        of the document(s) to Metadata containers.   For ensembles that
        means the Metadata for the ensemble and all members.  See the
        User Manual section on "CRUD Operations" for details.

        This reader also has an option to normalize with one or more sets of
        data during reading.  For backward compatibility with versions of
        MsPASS prior to 2.0 the "normalize" parameter will accept a list of
        strings that are assumed to be collection names containing
        Metadata that is to be "normalized".    That case, however, invokes the
        slowest algorithm possible to do that operation.  Not only does it
        use a query-based matching algorithm that requires a MongoDB find_one
        query for each datum, but it requires construction of an instance of
        the python class used in MsPASS for each calls and each collection listed.
        Better performance is normally possible with the v2 approach where
        the list passed via "normalize" is a list of subclasses of the
        :class:`mspasspy.db.normalize.BasicMatcher` class.  That interface
        provides a generic matching functionality and is most useful for
        improving performance when using one of the cache algorithms.
        For more detail see the User Manual section on normalization.

        Finally, this reader has to handle a special case of errors that
        cause the result to be invalid.  We do NOT use the standard
        exception mechanism for this reader because as noted in our User
        Manual throwing exceptions can abort a large parallel job.  Hence,
        we must try to minimize the cases when a single read operation will
        kill a larger workflow.  (That is reserved for truly unrecoverable
        errors like a malloc error.)  Throughout MsPASS we handle this issue
        with the `live` attribute of data objects.   All data objects,
        including ensembles, can be killed (marked data or live==False) as
        a signal they can be moved around but should be ignored in any
        processing workflows.  Reading data in is a special case.  A
        single read may fail for a variety of reasons but killing the entire
        job for something like one document containing an invalid attribute
        is problematic.  For that reason, this reader defines the concept
        of a special type of dead datum it calls an "abortion".   This
        concept is discussed in greater detail in the User's Manual section on
        "CRUD Operations", but for this context there are three key points:

        -  Any return from this function that is marked dead (live==False)
           is by definition an abortion.
        -  This reader adds a boolean attribute not stored in the database
           with the key "is_abortion".  That value will be True if the datum
           is returned dead but should be False if it is set live.
        -  An entire ensemble may be marked dead only if reading of all the
           members defined by a cursor input fail.   Note handling of
           failures when constructing ensembles is different than atomic
           data because partial success is assumed to be acceptable.
           Hence, when a given datum in an ensemble fails the body is not
           added to the ensemble but processed the body is buried in a
           special collection called "abortions".   See User's Manual
           for details.

        :param id_doc_or_cursor: required key argument that drives
          what the reader will return.  The type of this argument is a
          top-level control on what is read.   See above for details.
        :type id_doc_or_cursor:  As the name implies should be one of
          the following:  (1) MongoDB `ObjectId` of wf document to be
          retrieved to define this read, (2) MongoDB document (python dict)
          of data defining the datum to be constructed, or (3) a pymongo
          `Cursor` object that can be iterated to load an enemble.

        :param mode: read mode that controls how the function interacts with
          the schema definition.   Must be one of
          ['promiscuous','cautious','pedantic'].   See user's manual for a
          detailed description of what the modes mean.  Default is 'promiscuous'
          which turns off all schema checks and loads all attributes defined for
          each object read.
        :type mode: :class:`str`

        :param normalize: Use this parameter to do normalization during read.
          From version 2 onward the preferred input is a list of
          concrete instances of the base class :class:`BasicMatcher`.
          For backward compatibility this parameter may also defined a
          list of collection names defined by a list of strings.
          Note all normalizers will, by default,
          normally kill any datum for which matching fails.  Note for
          ensembles this parameter defines matching to be applied to all
          enemble members.  Use `normalize_ensemble` to normalize the enemble's
          `Metadata` container.  Member ensemble normalziation can be different
          for each member while ensemble Metadata is assume  the same for
          all members.
        :type normalize: a :class:`list` of :class:`BasicMatcher` or :class:`str`.
          :class:`BasicMatchers` are applied sequentialy with the
          `normalize` function using this matcher.   When a list of strings is given each
          call to this function initiates construction of a database Id
          matcher using the collection name.   e.g. if the list has "source"
          the wf read is expected to contain the attribute "source_id"
          that resolves to an id in the source collection.  With string
          input that always happens only through database transactions.

        :param normalize_ensemble:  This parameter should be used to
          apply normalization to ensemble Metadata (attributes common to
          all ensemble "members". )  It will be ignored if reading
          atomic data.  Otherwise it behaves like normalize
        :type normalize_ensemble:  a :class:`list` of :class:`BasicMatcher` or :class:`str`.
          :class:`BasicMatchers` are applied sequentialy with the
          `normalize` function.   When a list of strings is given each
          call to this function initiates construction of an database Id
          matcher using the collection name.   e.g. if the list has "source"
          the wf read is expected to contain the attribute "source_id"
          that resolves to an id in the source collection.  With string
          input that always happens only through database transactions.

        :param load_history: boolean switch controlling handling of the
          object-level history mechanism.  When True if the data were
          saved previously with a comparable switch to save the
          history, this reader will load the history data.   This feature allows
          preserving a complete object-level history tree in a workflow
          with an intermediate save.   If no history data are found the
          history tree is initialized. When this parameter is set False
          the history tree will be left null.

        :param exclude_keys: Sometimes it is helpful to remove one or more
          attributes stored in the database from the data's Metadata (header)
          so they will not cause problems in downstream processing.  Use this
          argument to supply a list of keys that should be deleted from
          the datum before it is returned.  With ensembles the editing
          is applied to all members.   Note this same functionality
          can be accomplished within a workflow with the trace editing
          module.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str` defining
          the keys to be cleared.

        :param collection:  Specify the collection name for this read.
           In MsPASS the equivalent of header attributes are stored in
           MongoDB documents contained in a "collection".   The assumption
           is a given collection only contains documents for one of the
           two atomic types defined in MsPASS:  `TimeSeries` or `Seismogram`.
           The data type for collections defined by the schema is an
           attribute that the reader tests to define the type of atomic
           objects to be constructed (Note ensembles are assembled from
           atomic objects by recursive calls the this same read method.)
           The default is "wf_TimeSeries", but we recommend always defining
           this argument for clarity and stability in the event the default
           would change.
         :type collection:   :class:`str` defining a collection that must be
           defined in the schema.  If not, the function will abort the job.

        :param data_tag:  The definition of a dataset can become ambiguous
          when partially processed data are saved within a workflow.   A common
          example would be windowing long time blocks of data to shorter time
          windows around a particular seismic phase and saving the windowed data.
          The windowed data can be difficult to distinguish from the original
          with standard queries.  For this reason we make extensive use of "tags"
          for save operations to avoid such ambiguities.   Reads present
          a different problem as selection for such a tag is best done with
          MongoDB queries.   If set this argument provides a cross validation
          that the data are consistent with a particular tag.  In particular,
          if a datum does not have the attribute "data_tag" set to the value
          defined by the argument a null, dead datum will be returned.
          For ensembles any document defined by the cursor input for which
          the "data_tag" attribute does not match will be silenetly dropped.
          The default is None which disables the cross-checking.
        :type data_tag: :class:`str` used for the filter.  Can be None
          in which case the cross-check test is disable.

        :param ensemble_metadata:  Optional constant attributes to
          assign to ensemble Metadata.  Ignored for atomic data.
          It is important to stress that the contents of this dict are
          applied last.  Use with caution, particularly when using
          normalizatoin, to avoid accidentally overwriting some
          attribute loaded from the database.
        :type ensemble_metadata:  python dict.   The contents are copied
          verbatim to the ensemble Metadata container with a loop over the
          dict keys.

        :param alg_name: optional alternative name to assign for this algorithm
          as a tag for the origin node of the history tree.   Default is the
          function's name ("read_data") and should rarely if ever be changed.
          Ignored unless `load_history` is set True.
        :type alg_name: :class:`str`

        :param alg_id: The object-level history mechanism uses a string to
          tag a specific instance of running a particular function in a workflow.
          If a workflow has multiple instances of read_data with different
          parameters, for example, one might specify a value of this argument.
          Ignored unless `load_history` is set True.
        :type alg_id: :class:`str`

        :param define_as_raw: boolean to control a detail of the object-level
          history definition of the tree node created for this process.
          The functions by definition an "origin" but a special case is a
          "raw" origin meaning the sample data are unaltered (other than type)
          from the field data.  Most miniseed data, for example, would
          want to set this argument True.   Ignored unless `load_history` is set True.

        :param merge_method:  when reading miniseed data implied gaps can
          be present when packets are missing from a sequence of packets
          having a common net:sta:chan:loc codes.  We use obspy's
          miniseed reader to crack miniseed data.  It breaks such data into
          multiple "segments".  We then use their
          `merge<https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.merge.html>`__
          method of the "Stream" object to glue any such segments together.
          This parameter is passed as the "method" argument to that function.
          For detail see
          `__add__ <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.__add__.html#obspy.core.trace.Trace.__add__>`
          for details on methods 0 and 1,
          See `_cleanup <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream._cleanup.html#obspy.core.stream.Stream._cleanup>`
          for details on method -1.  Note this argument is ignored unless
          the reader is trying to read miniseed data.
        :type method: :class:`int` with one of three values: -1, 0, or 1

        :param merge_fill_value: Fill value for gap processing when obspy's merge
          method is invoked.  (see description for "merge_method" above).
          The value given here is passed used as the "fill" argument to
          the obspy merge method.  As with merge_method this argument is
          relevant only when reading miniseed data.
        :type merge_fill_value: :class:`int`, :class:`float` or None (default)

        :param merge_interpolation_samples: when merge_method is set to
          -1 the obspy merge function requires a value for an
          argument they call "interpolate_samples".  See their documentation
          for details, but this argument controls how "overlaps", as opposed
          to gaps, are handled by merge.  See the function documentation
          `here<https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.merge.html>`__
          for details.
        :type interpolation_samples: :class:`int`

        :return: for ObjectId python dictionary values of arg0 will return
          either a :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries`
          or :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram` object.
          If arg0 is a pymongo Cursor the function will return a
          :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeriesEnsemble` or
          :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.SeismogramEnsemble` object.
          As noted above failures in reading atomic data will result in
          an object be marked dead and the Metadata attribute "is_abortion"
          to be set True.  When reading ensembles any problem members will
          be excluded from the output and the bodies buried in a special
          collection called "abortions".

        Standard method to save all seismic data objects to be managed by
        MongoDB.

        This method provides a unified interface for saving all seismic
        data objects in MsPASS.   That is, what we call atomic data
        (:class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` and
        :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`) and ensembles of the
        two atomic types ():class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeriesEnsemble` and
        :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.SeismogramEnsemble`).  Handling
        multiple types while simultaneously supporting multiple abstractions
        of how the data are stored externally has some complexities.
        1.  All MsPASS data have multiple containers used internally
            to define different concepts.   In particular atomic data
            have a Metadata container we map to MongoDB documents directly,
            sample data that is the largest data component that we handle
            multiple ways, error log data, and (optional) object-level
            history data.  Ensembles are groups of atomic data but they also
            contain a Metadata and error log container common with content
            common to the group.
        2.  With seismic data the size is normally dominated by the
            sample data that are stored internally as a vector container
            for `TimeSeries` objects and a matrix for `Seismogram` objects.
            Handling moving that data to storage as fast as possible is thus the
            key to optimize write performance.  The write process is further
            complicated, however, by the fact that "write/save" is itself
            an abstraction that even in FORTRAN days hid a lot of complexity.
            A call to this function supports multiple save mechanisms we
            define through the `storage_mode` keyword. At present
            "storage_mode" can be only one of two options:  "files" and
            "gridfs".  Note this class has prototype code for reading data
            in AWS s3 cloud storage that is not yet part of this interface.
            The API, however, was designed to allow adding one or more
            "storage_mode" options that allow other mechanisms to save
            sample data.  The top priority for a new "storage_mode" when
            the details are finalized is cloud storage of FDSN data by
            Earthscope and other data centers.  We have also experimented
            with parallel file containers like HDF5 for improved IO performance
            but have not yet produced a stable implementation.   In the
            future look for all such improvements.  What is clear is the
            API will define these alternatives through the "storage_mode"
            concept.
        3.  In MsPASS we make extensive use of the idea from seismic reflection
            processing of marking problem data "dead".   This method
            handles all dead data through a standard interface with the
            memorable/colorful name :py:class:`mspasspy.util.Undertaker`.
            The default save calls the "bury" method of that class, but
            there is an optional "cremate" argument that calls that
            method instead.  The default of "bury" writes error log data
            to a special collection ("cemetery") while the "cremate" method
            causes dead data to vanish without a trace on save.
        4.  There are two types of save concepts this method has to support.
            That is, sometimes one needs to save intermediate results of
            a workflow and continue on doing more work on the same data.
            The more common situation is to terminate a workflow with
            a call to this method.  The method argument `return_data`
            is an implicit switch for these two concepts.  When
            `return_data` is False, which is the default, only the
            ObjectId(s) of thw wf document(s) are returned by the function.
            We use that as the default to avoid memory overflow in a
            final save when the `compute` method is called in dask or the
            `collect` method is called in pyspark.  Set the `return_data`
            argument True if you are doing an intermediate save and want
            to reuse the content of what is returned.
        5.  There is a long history in seismology of debate on data formats.
            The fundamental reason for much of the debate has to do with
            the namespace and concepts captured in data "headers" for
            different formats seismologists have invented over several
            decades.   A type example is that two "standard" formats
            are SEGY that is the universal standard in seismic reflection
            data exchange and SEED which is now the standard earthquakek
            data format (Technically most data is now "miniseed" which
            differs from SEED by defining only minimal header attributes
            compared to the abomination of SEED that allows pretty much
            anything stored in an excessively complex data structure.)
            Further debate occurs regarding how data sets are stored in
            a particular format.   These range from the atomic level file
            model of SAC to the opposite extreme of an entire data set
            stored in one file, which is common for SEGY.   Because of the
            complexity of multiple formats seismologists have used for
            the external representation of data, this writer has limits
            on what it can and cannot do.  Key points about how formatting
            is handled are:
            -  The default save is a native format that is fast and efficient.
               You can select alternative formats for data by setting a valid
               value (string) for the "format" argument to this method.
               What is "valid" for the format argument is currently simple
               to state:   the value received for format is passed directly
               to obspy's  Stream write method's format argument.  That is,
               realize that when saving to a nonnative format the first thing
               this method does is convert the data to a Stream.  It then
               calls obspy's write method with the format specified.
            -  Given the above, it follows that if you are writing data to
               any nonnative format before calling this function you will
               almost certainly have to edit the Metadata of each datum to
               match the namespace for the format you want to write.
               If not, obspy's writer will almost certainly fail.  The only
               exception is miniseed where if the data being processed originate
               as miniseed they can often be saved as miniseed without edits.
            -  This writer only saves atomic data on single ensembles and
               knows nothing about assumptions a format makes about the
               larger scale layout of a dataset.  e.g. you could theoretically
               write an ensemble in SAC format, but the output will be
               unreadable by SAC because multiple records could easily be written
               in a single file.  Our perspective is that MsPASS is a framework
               and we do not have resources to sort out all the complexities of
               all the formats out there.   We request the user community to
               share an development for nonstandard formats.   Current the
               only format options that are not "use at your own risk" are
               the native "binary" format and miniseed.

        Given the complexity just described, users should not be surprised
        that there are limits to what this single method can do and that
        evolution of its capabilities is inevitable as the IT world evolves.
        We reiterate the entire point of this method (also the related
        read_data method) is to abstract the save process to make it
        as simple as possible while providing mechanisms to make it work
        as efficiently as possible.

        There are some important implementation details related to
        the points above that are important to understand if you encounter
        issues using this algorithm.
        1.  Writing is always atomic.  Saving ensemble data is little more
            than an enhanced loop over data members.  By "enhanced" we mean
            two things:  (a)  any ensemble Metadata attributes are copied
            to the documents saved for each member, and (b) dead data have
            to be handled differently but the handling is a simple conditional
            of "if live" with dead data handled the same as atomic bodies.
        2.  Atomic saves handle four components of the MsPASS data objects
            differently.   The first thing saved is always the sample data.
            How that is done depends upon the storage mode and format
            discussed in more detail below.  The writer then saves the
            content of the datum's Metadata container returning a copy of
            the value of the ObjectId of the document saved.   That ObjectID
            is used as a cross reference for saving the final two fundamentally
            different components:  (a) any error log entries and (b) object-level
            history data (optional).
        3.  As noted above how the sample data is stored is driven by the
            "storage_mode" argument.  Currently two values are accepted.
            "gridfs", which is the default, pushes the sample data to a
            MongoDB managed internal file space the documents refer to with
            that name.  There are two important caveats about gridfs storage.
            First, the data saved will use the same file system as that used
            by the database server.  That can easily cause a file-system full
            error or a quota error if used naively.   Second, gridfs IO is
            prone to a serious preformance issue in a parallel workflow as
            all workers can be shouting at the database server simultaneously
            filling the network connection and/or overloading the server.
            For those reasons, "files" should be used for the storage
            mode for most applications.   It is not the default because
            storing data in files always requires the user to implement some
            organizational scheme through the "dir" and "dfile" arguments.
            There is no one-size-fits-all solution for organizing how a
            particular project needs to organize the files it produces.
            Note, however, that one can set storage_mode to "files" and this
            writer will work.  By default is sets "dir" to the current directory
            and "dfile" to a random string created with a uuid generator.
            (For ensembles the default is to write all member data to
            the file defined explicitly or implicitly by the "dir" and "dfile"
            arguments.)   An final implementation detail is that if "dir"
            and "dfile" are left at the default None, the algorithm will
            attempt to extract the value of "dir" and "dfile" from the
            Metadata of an atomic datum referenced in the save (i.e. for
            ensembles each datum will be treated independently.).  That
            feature allows more complex data organization schemes managed
            externally from the writer for ensembles.  All of that was
            designed to make this method as bombproof as possible, but
            users need to be aware naive usage can create a huge mess.
            e.g. with "files" and null "dir" and "dfile" saving a million
            atomic data will create a million files with random names in
            your current directory.  Good luck cleaning that mess up.
            Finally, we reiterate that when Earthscope finishes their
            design work for cloud storage access there will probably be
            a new storage mode added to support that access.  The "s3"
            methods in `Database` should be viewed only as prototypes.
        4.  If any datum has an error log entry it is always saved by
            this method is a collection called "elog".  That save is not
            optional as we view all error log entries as significant.
            Each elog document contains an ObjectId of the wf document
            with which it is associated.
        5.  Handling of the bodies of dead data has some complexity.
            Since v2 of `Database` all dead data are passed through an
            instance of :py:class:`mspasspy.util.Undertaker`.  By default
            atomic dead data are passed through the
            :py:meth:`mspasspy.util.Undertaker.bury` method.
            If the "cremate" argument is set True the
            :py:meth:`mspasspy.util.Undertaker.cremate` method will be called.
            For ensembles the writer calls the
            :py:meth:`mspasspy.util.Undertaker.bring_out_your_dead`.
            If cremate is set True the bodies are discarded. Otherwise
            the `bury` method is called in a loop over all bodies.
            Note the default `bury` method creates
            a document for each dead datum in one of two
            special collections:  (a) data killed by a processing algorithm
            are saved to the "cemetery" collection, and (b) data killed by
            a reader are saved to "abortions" (An abortion is a datum
            that was never successfully constructed - born.)  The documents
            for the two collections contain the same name-value pairs but
            we split them because action required by an abortion is
            very different from a normal kill.   See the User Manual
            section on "CRUD Operations" for information on this topic.
        6.  Object-level history is not saved unless the argument
            "save_history" is set True (default is False).   When enabled
            the history data (if defined) is saved to a collection called
            "history".   The document saved, like elog, has the ObjectId of
            the wf document with which it is associated.  Be aware that there
            is a signficant added cost to creating a history document entry.
            Because calling this method is part of the history chain one
            would want to preserve, an atomic database operation is
            required for each datum saved.   That is, the algorithm
            does an update of the wf document with which it it is associated
            containing the ObjectId of the history document it saved.
        7.  As noted above saving data with "format" set to anything but
            the default "binary" or "MSEED" is adventure land.
            We reiterate saving other formats is a development frontier we
            hope to come as contributions from users who need writers for a particular
            format and are intimately familiar with that format's idiosyncracies.
        8.  The "mode" argument has a number of subtle idiosyncracies
            that need to be recognized.  In general we recommend always
            writing data (i.e. calling this method) with the default
            mode of "promiscuous".  That guarantees you won't mysteriously
            lose data being saved or abort the workflow when it is finished.
            In general it is better to use one of the verify methods or the
            dbverify command line tool to look for problem attributes in
            any saved documents than try to enforce rules setting
            mode to "cautious" or "pedantic".   On the other hand, even
            if running in "promiscuous" mode certain rules are enforced:
             -  Any aliases defined in the schema are always reset to the
                key defined for the schema.  e.g. if you used the alias
                "dt" for the data sample interval this writer will always
                change it to "delta" (with the standard schema anyway)
                before saving the document created from that datum.
             -  All modes enforce a schema constraint for "readonly"
                attributes.   An immutable (readonly) attribute by definition
                should not be changed during processing.   During a save
                all attributes with a key defined as readonly are tested
                with a method in the Metadata container that keeps track of
                any Metadata changes.  If a readonly attribute is found to
                have been changed it will be renamed with the prefix
                "READONLYERROR_", saved, and an error posted (e.g. if you try
                to alter site_lat (a readonly attribute) in a workflow when
                you save the waveform you will find an entry with the key
                READONERROR_site_lat.)  We emphasize the issue happens if
                the value associated with such a key was altered after the
                datum was constructed.  If the attribute does not
                change it is ERASED and will not appear in the document.
                The reason for that is this feature exists to handle
                attributes loaded in normalization.   Be aware this
                feature can bloat the elog collection if an entire dataset
                share a problem this algorithm flags as a readonly error.

        This method can throw an exception but only for errors in
        usage (i.e. arguments defined incorrectly)

        :param mspass_object: the seismic object you want to save.
        :type mspass_object: :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries`,
          :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`,
          :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeriesEnsemble`, or
          :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.SeismogramEnsemble`
        :param return_data: When True return a (usually edited) copy
        of the data received.   When False, the default, return only
        a requested subset of the attributes in the wf document saved
        for this datum.s
        :param return_list:  list of keys for attributes to extract
          and set for return python dictionary when return_data is False.
          Ignored if return_data is True.   Be warned for ensembles the
          attributes are expected to be in the ensemble Metadata container.
          Missing attributes will be silentely ignored so an empty dict
          will be returned if none of the attributes is this list are defined.
        :param mode: This parameter defines how attributes defined with
          key-value pairs in MongoDB documents are to be handled on reading.
          By "to be handled" we mean how strongly to enforce name and type
          specification in the schema for the type of object being constructed.
          Options are ['promiscuous','cautious','pedantic'] with 'promiscuous'
          being the default.  See the User's manual for more details on
          the concepts and how to use this option.
        :type mode: :class:`str`
        :param storage_mode: Current must be either "gridfs" or "file.  When set to
          "gridfs" the waveform data are stored internally and managed by
          MongoDB.  If set to "file" the data will be stored in a file system
          with the dir and dfile arguments defining a file name.   The
          default is "gridfs".  See above for more details.
        :type storage_mode: :class:`str`
        :param dir: file directory for storage.  This argument is ignored if
          storage_mode is set to "gridfs".  When storage_mode is "file" it
          sets the directory in a file system where the data should be saved.
          Note this can be an absolute or relative path.  If the path is
          relative it will be expanded with the standard python library
          path functions to a full path name for storage in the database
          document with the attribute "dir".  As for any io we remind the
          user that you much have write permission in this directory.
          Note if this argument is None (default) and storage_mode is "files"
          the algorithm will first attempt to extract "dir" from the
          Metadata of mspass_object.  If that is defined it will be used
          as the write directory. If it is not defined it will default to
          the current directory.
        :type dir: :class:`str`
        :param dfile: file name for storage of waveform data.  As with dir
          this parameter is ignored if storage_mode is "gridfs" and is
          required only if storage_mode is "file".   Note that this file
          name does not have to be unique.  The writer always positions
          the write pointer to the end of the file referenced and sets the
          attribute "foff" to that position. That allows automatic appends to
          files without concerns about unique names.  Like the dir argument
          if this argument is None (default) and storage_mode is "files"
          the algorithm will first attempt to extract "dfile" from the
          Metadata of mspass_object.  If that is defined it will be used
          as the output filename. If it is not defined a uuid generator
          is used to create a file name with a random string of characters.
          That usage is never a good idea, but is a feature added to make
          this method more bombproof.
        :type dfile: :class:`str`
        :param format: the format of the file. This can be one of the
          `supported formats <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.write.html#supported-formats>`__
          of ObsPy writer. The default the python None which the method
          assumes means to store the data in its raw binary form.  The default
          should normally be used for efficiency.  Alternate formats are
          primarily a simple export mechanism.  See the User's manual for
          more details on data export.  Used only for "file" storage mode.
          A discussion of format caveats can be found above.
        :type format: :class:`str`
        :param overwrite:  If true gridfs data linked to the original
          waveform will be replaced by the sample data from this save.
          Default is false, and should be the normal use.  This option
          should never be used after a reduce operator as the parents
          are not tracked and the space advantage is likely minimal for
          the confusion it would cause.   This is most useful for light, stable
          preprocessing with a set of map operators to regularize a data
          set before more extensive processing.  It can only be used when
          storage_mode is set to gridfs.
        :type overwrite:  boolean

        :param exclude_keys: Metadata can often become contaminated with
          attributes that are no longer needed or a mismatch with the data.
          A type example is the bundle algorithm takes three TimeSeries
          objects and produces a single Seismogram from them.  That process
          can, and usually does, leave things like seed channel names and
          orientation attributes (hang and vang) from one of the components
          as extraneous baggage.   Use this of keys to prevent such attributes
          from being written to the output documents.  Note if the data being
          saved lack these keys nothing happens so it is safer, albeit slower,
          to have the list be as large as necessary to eliminate any potential
          debris.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection: The default for this parameter is the python
          None.  The default should be used for all but data export functions.
          The normal behavior is for this writer to use the object
          data type to determine the schema is should use for any type or
          name enforcement.  This parameter allows an alernate collection to
          be used with or without some different name and type restrictions.
          The most common use of anything other than the default is an
          export to a diffrent format.
        :param data_tag: a user specified "data_tag" key.  See above and
          User's manual for guidance on how the use of this option.
        :type data_tag: :class:`str`
        :param cremate:  boolean controlling how dead data are handled.
          When True a datum marked dead is ignored and the body or a
          shell of the body (what depends on the return_list value) is
          returned.  If False (default) the
          :py:meth:`mspasspy.util.Undertaker.bury` method is called
          with body as input.  That creates a document for each dead
          datum either in the "cemetery" or "abortions" collection.
          See above for more deails.
        :param save_history:   When True the optional history data will
          be saved to the database if it was actually enabled in the workflow.
          If the history container is empty will silently do nothing.
          Default is False meaning history data is ignored.
        :return: python dict of requested attributes by default.  Edited
          copy of input when return_data is True.

        This method can be used to fix a subset of common database problems
        created during processing that can cause problems if the user tries to
        read data saved with such blemishes.   The subset of problems
        are defined as those that are identified by the "dbverify" command
        line tool or it's Database equivalent (the verify method of this class).
        This method is an alternative to the command line tool dbclean.  Use
        this method for fixes applied as part of a python script.

        :param collection: the collection you would like to clean. If not specified, use the default wf collection
        :type collection: :class:`str`
        :param query: this is a python dict that is assumed to be a query
         to MongoDB to limit suite of documents to which the requested cleanup
         methods are applied.  The default will process the entire database
         collection specified.
        :type query: :class:`dict`
        :param rename_undefined: when set the options is assumed to contain
          a python dict defining how to rename a set of attributes. Each member
          of the dict is assumed to be of the form ``{original_key:new_key}``
          Each document handled will change the key from "original_key" to
          "new_key".
        :type rename_undefined: :class:`dict`
        :param delete_undefined: attributes undefined in the schema can
          be problematic.  As a minimum they waste storage and memory if they
          are baggage.  At worst they may cause a downstream process to abort
          or mark some or all data dead.  On the other hand, undefined data may
          contain important information you need that for some reason is
          not defined in the schema.  In that case do not run this method to
          clear these.  When set true all attributes matching the query will
          have undefined attributes cleared.
        :param required_xref_list: in MsPASS we use "normalization" of some common
          attributes for efficiency.  The stock ones currently are "source", "site",
          and "channel".  This list is a intimately linked to the
          delete_missing_xref option.  When that is true this list is
          enforced to clean debris.  Typical examples are ['site_id','source_id']
          to require source and receiver geometry.

        function operates silently assuming the caller will
        create a readable report from the return that defines
        the documents that had errors.  This function is used in the
        verify standalone program that acts as a front end to tests
        in this module.  The function can be run in independently
        so there is a verbose option to print errors as they are encountered.

        :param collection:  mspass waveform collection on which the normalization
        check is to be performed.  default is wf_TimeSeries.

        :param wfquery:  optional dict passed as a query to limit the
        documents scanned by the function.   Default will process the
        entire wf collection.
        :param verbose:  when True errors will be printed.  By default
        the function works silently and you should use the output to
        interact with any errors returned.
        :param error_limit: Is a sanity check on the number of errors logged.
        Errors of any type are limited to this number (default 1000).
        The idea is errors should be rare and if this number is exceeded
        you have a big problem you need to fix before scanning again.
        The number should be large enough to catch all condition but
        not so huge it become cumbersome.  With no limit or a memory
        fault is even possible on a huge dataset.
        :return:  returns a tuple with two lists.  Both lists are ObjectIds
        of the scanned wf collection that have errors.  component 0
        of the tuple contains ids of wf entries that have the normalization

        This function checks the integrity of all attributes

        in the database and what is defined for the schema, and (2)
        data with a key that is not recognized.  Both tests are necessary

        about type and exactly what goes into a document.  MongoDB pretty
        much allow type it knows about to be associated with any key

        Use this method if you want to save the output of a processing algorithm

        metadata field, or as elaborate as a bound FORTRAN or C/C++ function
        that computes something, posts the results to Metadata, but doesn't
        actually alter the sample data.   A type example of the later is an amplitude
        calculation that posts the computed amplitude to some metadata key value.

        This method will ONLY attempt to update Metadata attributes stored in the

        for all "mode" parameters if an key is defined in the schema as
        readonly and it is listed as having been modified, it will
        be save with a new key creating by adding the prefix
        "READONLYERROR_" .  e.g. if we had a site_sta read as
        'AAK' but we changed it to 'XYZ' in a workflow, when we tried
        to save the data you will find an entry in the document
        of {'READONLYERROR_site_sta' : 'XYZ'}

        :param mspass_object: the object you want to update.
        :type mspass_object: either :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` or :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`
        :param exclude_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to exclude from being updated.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param force_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to force
         to be updated.   Normally this method will only update attributes
         that have been marked as changed since creation of the parent data
         object.  If data with these keys is found in the mspass_object they
         will be added to the update record.
        :type force_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection: the collection name you want to use. If not specified, use the defined collection in the metadata schema.
        :param mode: This parameter defines how attributes defines how
          strongly to enforce schema constraints. As described above
          'promiscuous' justs updates all changed values with no schema
          tests.  'cautious', the default, enforces type constraints and
          tries to convert easily fixed type mismatches (e.g. int to floats
          of vice versa).  Both 'cautious' and 'pedantic' may leave one or
          more complaint message in the elog of mspass_object on how the
          method did or did not fix mismatches with the schema.  Both
          also will drop any key-value pairs where the value cannot be
          converted to the type defined in the schema.

        :type mode: :class:`str`
        :param alg_name: alg_name is the name the func we are gonna save while preserving the history.
        :type alg_name: :class:`str`
        :param alg_id: alg_id is a unique id to record the usage of func while preserving the history.
        :type alg_id: :class:`bson.ObjectId.ObjectId`
        :return: mspass_object data.  Normally this is an unaltered copy
          of the data passed through mspass_object.  If there are errors,
          however, the elog will contain new messages.  Note any such
          messages are volatile and will not be saved to the database
          until the save_data method is called.

        collections and storage methods, doing a full data update has some
        complexity.   This method handles the problem differently for the
        different pieces:
            1. An update is performed on the parent wf collection document.
               That update makes use of the related Database method
               called update_metadata.
            2. If the error log is not empty it is saved.
            3. If the history container has contents it is saved.
            4. The sample data is the thorniest problem. Currently this
               method will only do sample updates for data stored in
               the mongodb gridfs system.   With files containing multiple
               waveforms it would be necessary to append to the files and
               this could create a blaat problem with large data sets so
               we do not currently support that type of update.

        A VERY IMPORTANT implicit feature of this method is that
        if the magic key "gridfs_id" exists the sample data in the
        input to this method (mspass_object.data) will overwrite any
        the existing content of gridfs found at the matching id.   This
        is a somewhat hidden feature so beware.

        :param mspass_object: the object you want to update.
        :type mspass_object: either :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` or :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`
        :param exclude_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to exclude from being updated.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param force_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to force
         to be updated.   Normally this method will only update attributes
         that have been marked as changed since creation of the parent data
         object.  If data with these keys is found in the mspass_object they
         will be added to the update record.
        :type force_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection: the collection name you want to use. If not specified, use the defined collection in the metadata schema.
        :param mode: This parameter defines how attributes defines how
          strongly to enforce schema constraints. As described above
          'promiscuous' justs updates all changed values with no schema
          tests.  'cautious', the default, enforces type constraints and
          tries to convert easily fixed type mismatches (e.g. int to floats
          of vice versa).  Both 'cautious' and 'pedantic' may leave one or
          more complaint message in the elog of mspass_object on how the
          method did or did not fix mismatches with the schema.  Both
          also will drop any key-value pairs where the value cannot be
          converted to the type defined in the schema.
        :type mode: :class:`str`
        :param alg_name: alg_name is the name the func we are gonna save while preserving the history.
          (defaults to 'Database.update_data' and should not normally need to be changed)
        :type alg_name: :class:`str`
        :param alg_id: alg_id is a unique id to record the usage of func while preserving the history.
        :type alg_id: :class:`bson.ObjectId.ObjectId`
        :return: mspass_object data.  Normally this is an unaltered copy
          of the data passed through mspass_object.  If there are errors,
          however, the elog will contain new messages.  All such messages,
          howevever, should be saved in the elog collection because elog
          is the last collection updated.

        Save an Ensemble container of a group of data objecs to MongoDB.

        DEPRICATED METHOD:  use save_method instead.

        Ensembles are a core concept in MsPASS that are a generalization of
        fixed "gather" types frozen into every seismic reflection processing
        system we know of.   This is is a writer for data stored in such a
        container.  It is little more than a loop over each "member" of the
        ensemble calling the Database.save_data method for each member.
        For that reason most of the arguments are passed downstream directly
        to save_data.   See the save_data method and the User's manual for
        more verbose descriptions of their behavior and expected use.

        The only complexity in handling an ensemble is that our implementation
        has a separate Metadata container associated with the overall group
        that is assumed to be constant for every member of the ensemble.  For this
        reason before entering the loop calling save_data on each member
        the method calls the objects sync_metadata method that copies (overwrites if
        previously defined) the ensemble attributes to each member.  That assure
        atomic saves will not lose their association with a unique ensemble
        indexing scheme.

        A final feature of note is that an ensemble can be marked dead.
        If the entire ensemble is set dead this function returns
        immediately and does nothing.

        Save an Ensemble container of a group of data objecs to MongoDB.

        Ensembles are a core concept in MsPASS that are a generalization of
        fixed "gather" types frozen into every seismic reflection processing
        system we know of.   This is is a writer for data stored in such a
        container.  It saves all the objects in the ensemble to one file.

        Our implementation has a separate Metadata container associated with the overall
        group that is assumed to be constant for every member of the ensemble.  For this
        reason the method calls the objects sync_metadata method that copies (overwrites
        if previously defined) the ensemble attributes to each member.  That assure
        atomic saves will not lose their association with a unique ensemble indexing scheme.

        A final feature of note is that an ensemble can be marked dead.
        If the entire ensemble is set dead this function returns
        immediately and does nothing.

        Delete method for handling mspass data objects (TimeSeries and Seismograms).

        Delete is one of the basic operations any database system should
        support (the last letter of the acronymn CRUD is delete).  Deletion is
        nontrivial with seismic data stored with the model used in MsPASS.
        The reason is that the content of the objects are spread between
        multiple collections and sometimes use storage in files completely
        outside MongoDB.   This method, however, is designed to handle that
        and when given the object id defining a document in one of the wf
        collections, it will delete the wf document entry and manage the
        waveform data.  If the data are stored in gridfs the deletion of
        the waveform data will be immediate.  If the data are stored in
        disk files the file will be deleted when there are no more references
        in the wf collection for the exact combination of dir and dfile associated
        an atomic deletion.  Error log and history data deletion linked to
        a datum is optional.  Note this is an expensive operation as it
        involves extensive database interactions.   It is best used for
        surgical solutions.   Deletion of large components of a data set
        (e.g. all data with a given data_tag value) are best done with
        custom scripts utilizing file naming conventions and unix shell
        commands to delete waveform files.

        Private method to provide generic reader of atomic data from a standard

        This method is used by read_data for reading atomic data.   Note
        ensembles are handled by a different set of private methods
        for efficiency.   The algorithm is a bit weird as it assumes
        the skeleton of the datum (mspass_object content received as arg0)
        has already created the storage arrays from sample data.
        That is done, in practice, with the C++ api that provides constructors
        driven by Metadata created from MongoDB documents.   Those constructors
        allocate and initialize the sample data arrays to zeros.

        Binary (default) format uses a C++ function and fread for loading
        sample data.  Other formats are passed to obspy's reader.

        Saves contents of all components of an obspy inventory
        object to documents in the site and channel collections.
        The site collection is sufficient for Seismogram objects but
        TimeSeries data will normally need to be connected to the
        channel collection.   The algorithm used will not add
        duplicates based on the following keys:

        For site:
            net
            sta
            chan
            loc
            starttime::endtime - this check is done cautiously with
              a 10 s fudge factor to avoid the issue of floating point
              equal tests.   Probably overly paranoid since these
              fields are normally rounded to a time at the beginning
              of a utc day, but small cost to pay for stabilty because
              this function is not expected to be run millions of times
              on a huge collection.

        for channels:
            net
            sta
            chan
            loc
            starttime::endtime - same approach as for site with same
               issues - note especially 10 s fudge factor.   This is
               necessary because channel metadata can change more
               frequently than site metadata (e.g. with a sensor
               orientation or sensor swap)

        The channel collection can contain full response data
        that can be obtained by extracting the data with the key
        "serialized_inventory" and running pickle loads on the returned
        string.

        A final point of note is that not all Inventory objects are created
        equally.   Inventory objects appear to us to be designed as an image
        of stationxml data.  The problem is that stationxml, like SEED, has to
        support a lot of complexity faced by data centers that end users
        like those using this package do not need or want to know.   The
        point is this method tries to untangle the complexity and aims to reduce the
        result to a set of documents in the site and channel collection
        that can be cross referenced to link the right metadata with all
        waveforms in a dataset.

        This method uses a restricted query to match the
        keys given and returns the document matching the specified keys.

        The optional loc code is handled specially.  The reason is
        that it is common to have the loc code empty.  In seed data that
        puts two ascii blank characters in the 2 byte packet header
        position for each miniseed blockette.  With pymongo that
        can be handled one of three ways that we need to handle gracefully.
        That is, one can either set a literal two blank character
        string, an empty string (""), or a MongoDB NULL.   To handle
        that confusion this algorithm first queries for all matches
        without loc defined.  If only one match is found that is
        returned immediately.  If there are multiple matches we
        search though the list of docs returned for a match to
        loc being conscious of the null string oddity.

        The (optional) time arg is used for a range match to find
        period between the site startime and endtime.  If not used
        the first occurence will be returned (usually ill adivsed)
        Returns None if there is no match.  Although the time argument
        is technically option it usually a bad idea to not include
        a time stamp because most stations saved as seed data have
        time variable channel metadata.

        This is the first stage import function for handling the import of
        miniseed data.  This function scans a data file defined by a directory
        (dir arg) and dfile (file name) argument.  I builds an index
        for the file and writes the index to mongodb
        in the collection defined by the collection
        argument (wf_miniseed by default).   The index is bare bones
        miniseed tags (net, sta, chan, and loc) with a starttime tag.
        The index is appropriate ONLY if the data on the file are created
        by concatenating data with packets sorted by net, sta, loc, chan, time
        AND the data are contiguous in time.   The original
        concept for this function came from the need to handle large files
        produced by concanentation of miniseed single-channel files created
        by obpsy's mass_downloader.   i.e. the basic model is the input
        files are assumed to be something comparable to running the unix
        cat command on a set of single-channel, contingous time sequence files.
        There are other examples that do the same thing (e.g. antelope's
        miniseed2days).

        We emphasize this function only builds an index - it does not
        convert any data.   It has to scan the entire file deriving the
        index from data retrieved from miniseed packets with libmseed so
        for large data sets this can take a long time.

        Actual seismic data stored as miniseed are prone to time tears.
        That can happen at the instrument level in at least two common
        ways: (1) dropped packets from telemetry issues, or (2) instrument
        timing jumps when a clock loses external lock to gps or some
        other standard and the rock is restored.  The behavior is this
        function is controlled by the input parameter
        segment_time_tears.  When true a new index entry is created
        any time the start time of a packet differs from that computed
        from the endtime of the last packet by more than one sample
        AND net:sta:chan:loc are constant.  The default for this
        parameter is false because data with many dropped packets from
        telemetry are common and can create overwhelming numbers of
        index entries quickly.  When false the scan only creates a new
        index record when net, sta, chan, or loc change between successive
        packets.  Our reader has gap handling functions to handle
        time tears.  Set segment_time_tears true only when you are
        confident the data set does not contain a large number of dropped
        packets.

        Note to parallelize this function put a list of files in a Spark
        RDD or a Dask bag and parallelize the call the this function.
        That can work because MongoDB is designed for parallel operations
        and we use the thread safe version of the libmseed reader.

        Finally, note that cross referencing with the channel and/or
        source collections should be a common step after building the
        index with this function.  The reader found elsewhere in this
        module will transfer linking ids (i.e. channel_id and/or source_id)
        to TimeSeries objects when it reads the data from the files
        indexed by this function.

        :param dfile:  file name of data to be indexed.  Asssumed to be
          the leaf node of the path - i.e. it contains no directory information
          but just the file name.
        :param dir:  directory name.  This can be a relative path from the
          current directory be be advised it will always be converted to an
          fully qualified path.  If it is undefined (the default) the function
          assumes the file is in the current working directory and will use
          the result of the python getcwd command as the directory path
          stored in the database.
        :param collection:  is the mongodb collection name to write the
          index data to.  The default is 'wf_miniseed'.  It should be rare
          to use anything but the default.
        :param segment_time_tears: boolean controlling handling of data gaps
          defined by constant net, sta, chan, and loc but a discontinuity
          in time tags for successive packets.  See above for a more extensive
          discussion of how to use this parameter.  Default is True.
        :param elog_collection:  name to write any error logs messages
          from the miniseed reader.  Default is "elog", which is the
          same as for TimeSeries and Seismogram data, but the cross reference
          keys here are keyed by "wf_miniseed_id".
        :param return_ids:  if set True the function will return a tuple
          with two id lists.  The 0 entry is an array of ids from the
          collection (wf_miniseed by default) of index entries saved and
          the 1 entry will contain the ids in the elog_collection of
          error log entry insertions.  The 1 entry will be empty if the
          reader found no errors and the error log was empty (the hopefully
          normal situation).  When this argument is False (the default) it
          returns None.  Set true if you need to build some kind of cross
          reference to read errors to build some custom cleaning method
          for specialized processing that can be done more efficiently.
          By default it is fast only to associate an error log entry with
          a particular waveform index entry. (we store the saved index
          MongoDB document id with each elog entry)
        :param normalize_channel:  boolean controlling normalization with
          the channel collection.   When set True (default is false) the
          method will call the Database.get_seed_channel method, extract
          the id from the result, and set the result as "channel_id" before
          writing the wf_miniseed document.  Set this argument true if
          you have a relatively complete channel collection assembled
          before running a workflow to index a set of miniseed files
          (a common raw data starting point).
        :param verbose:  boolean passed to get_seed_channel.  This
          argument has no effect unless normalize_channel is set True.
          It is necessary because the get_seed_channel function has no
          way to log errors except calling print.  A very common metadata
          error is duplicate and/or time overlaps in channel metadata.
          Those are usually harmless so the default for this parameter is
          False.  Set this True if you are using inline normalization
          (normalize_channel set True) and you aren't certain your
          channel collection has no serious inconsistencies.
        :exception: This function can throw a range of error types for
          a long list of possible io issues.   Callers should use a
          generic handler to avoid aborts in a large job.

        Function to save sample data arrays for any MsPASS data objects.

        The sample data in a seismic data object is normally dominates
        the size of the container.  This function standardizes saving the
        sample data with a single method.   Behavior is dependent upon
        parameters passed in a fairly complex way.   The behavor is best
        understood as a hierarchy summarized as follows:

        1)  The top level switch is the data type.  Atomic types
        (TimeSeries and Seismogram) are handled differently from ensembles.
        The main distinction is atomic saves always involve some version of
        open, write, and close where open and close may be a file handle or
        a network connection.  Ensembles are normally written to a single
        file, but there are options to dismember the ensemble into multiple
        files driven by the "dir" and "dfile" attributes of the members.
        See description below of "use_member_dfile_value" parameter.

        2) The "storage_mode" argument determines what medium will hold the
        sample data.  Currently accepted values are "files" and "gridfs"
        but other options may be added in the near future to support cloud
        computing.

        3) The "format" argument can be used to specify an alternative
        format for the output.  Most formats mix up metadata and sample
        data so be warned there is a mismatch in concept between this
        writer and implementations that write most formatted data.

        The user should be aware of an important issue with ensembles.
        For atomic data marked dead this function simply returns the dead
        datum immediately.  Ensembles do the same if the entire ensemble is
        marked dead, but for efficiency the function ASSUMES that there are
        no data marked dead within the ensemble.  Callers should guarantee
        that restriction by using methods in the Undertaker class to
        remove the dead from the container.

        :param mspass_object:  data to be saved.
        :type mspass_object:  must be one of TimeSeries, Seismogram,
          TimeSeriesEnsemble, or SeismogramEnsemble.  This function does NOT
          test input type for efficiency.  It also assumes the datum
          received was not previously marked dead.  dead data need to
          be handled differently in save.

        :param storage_mode:   is a string used to define the generic
          method for storing the sample data.  Currently must be one of
          two values or the function will throw an exception:
          (1) "file" causes data to be written to external files.
          (2) "gridfs" (the default) causes the sample data to be stored
               within the gridfs file system of MongoDB.
          See User's manuals for guidance on storage option tradeoffs.

        :param dir:  directory file is to be written. Just be writable
          by user or the function will throw an exception.   Default is None
          which initaties the following steps: if dir is defined in
          the object's Metadata (key "dir") that string is fetched and
          used.  If not defined, default to current directory of the process.

          (Ignored when storage_mode == "gridfs")
        :type dir:  string or None

        :param dfile:  file name to save the sample data for this object.
         Default is None which initaties the following steps: if dfile
         is defined in the current object's Metadata (key "dfile") the
         string value retrieved with the dfile key is used as the file
         name.  If not, a unique name will be generated with a uuid
         generator.   (Ignored when storage_mode=="gridfs")
        :type dfile:  string or None

        :param format:  optional format name to write data.  See above for
          limitations and caveats.  Default is None which is aliases to "binary"
          meaning a fwrite of sample array data. (Ignored when storage_mode == "gridfs")
        :type format:  string or None

        :param overwrite:  If True any file name generated form dir and dfile
          that already exists will be overwritten.  Default is Fals which means
          the function alway only appends data recording foff of the start
          position of the write. (Ignored when storage_mode == "gridfs")

        :exception:
        1) will raise a TypeError if mspass_object is not a mspass seismic
        data object (atomic or ensmebles).   That shouldnt' normally happen
        for use within the Database class but Users could experiment with
        custom writers that would use this class method.

        Private method to write sample data to a file.  Default is binary
        fwrite output of native vector of 8 byte floats (C double).

        This method puts file-based writing in a single function.   The
        function handles any of the 4 standard MsPASS seismic data objects
        BUT makes some big assumptions that caller did some housecleaning
        before calling this low-level function.   Key assumptions are:
        1.  For atomic data do NOT call this function if the datum is marked
            dead.
        2.  Similarly, ensembles are assumed pre-filtered to remove dead
            data.  A standard way to do that is with the Undertaker class.
        3.  If dir and dfile are defined the resulting path must be writable.
            If it is not the function will throw an exception.
        4.  If dir and dfile are not defined (left Null default) the
            function always tries to extract an attribute with the keys of
            "dir" and "dfile" from the object's metadata.  Note that for
            ensembles that means it will try to pull these from the ensemble
            metadata NOT that in any "member".  For all data if dir is not define
            it default to the current directory.  If dfile is not define a
            unique file name is generated from a uuid generator.
        5.  ensembles should normally be preceded by a call to sync_ensemble_metadata
            to push ensemble metadata entries to all members.

        Be aware normal behavior of this function is to not destroy any
        data in existing files.  By default, if a file already exists the
        sample data related to the current call is appended to the file.
        Set the overwrite argument True to change that behavior.

        Also be aware ensembles are ALWAYS written so all the sample data
        from the ensemble are in the same file.   Readers can extract an
        individual member later by using the foff attribute and npts
        and/or nbytes to know what section of the file is be to be read.

        The functions supports a format option.  By default data are written
        with the low-level C function fwrite dumping the internal array contents
        that hold the sample data.  That is always the fastest way to save
        the sample data.  When the format variable is set the name string
        for the format is passed directly to obspy's generic file writer
        for formatted data.   Be warned that approach may not make sense for
        all data types and all formats.  For example, SAC output only makes
        sense at the atomic level so writing an ensemble in SAC format produces
        output that is not directly readable by SAC but the file must be
        dismembered into pieces in an export.   That is feasible because the
        we store an "nbytes" attribute in the returned object's
        member Metadata containers.

        This function always opens a file and closes it on exit.  Each call
        to the function this always has the overhead of one open, one call
        to seek, and one to close.

        The function should always be called before saving the Metadata.
        The reason is all the information about where it saves data are
        returned as Metadata attributes.  For atomic data it is in the
        return of the data.  For ensembles each member's Metadata contain
        the required attributes needed to reconstruct the object.

        :type mspass_object:  must be one of TimeSeries, Seismogram,

    def _group_mdlist(mdlist) -> dict:
        """
        Private method to separate the documents in mdlist into groups
        that simplify reading of ensembles.

        We allow ensembles o be created from data retrieved and constucted
        by mulitple methods.    Currently that is defined by three concepts
        we have to separate:
            1.  The "storage_mode" passed to readers defines the generic
                way data are stored.  The list of storage_mode options
                is fairly long.  The point is that different storage modes
                require fundamentally different read strategies.  e.g. reading
                from s3 is not remotely at all like reading from gridfs
                but both can yield valid data objects.
            2.  A "format" can be used to define a format conversion that
                needs to be preformed on the fly to convert the data to
                mspass atomic data object.
            3.  A special case with storage mode == "files is when the
                data are organized into files already defined for this
                enemble being read.  A typical example would be data already
                bundled into n ensemble and saved that way with the
                Database.save_data method in an earlier run.  Ensemble
                files can be read faster by reducing the need for
                unnecessary file open/close pairs that are otherwise
                needed when reading atomic data.

        This function takes the input list of documents converted to
        to a list of `mspasspy.ccore.utility.Metadata` objects and sorts
        the contents into containers that define data that can be
        read by a common method.   We do that by returning a nested
        dictionary.  The top level of the dictionary is keyed by
        the "storage_mode".   Most inputs are likely to only generate
        a single key but this approach allows heterogeous input
        definitions in a database.   Each value then defines a second
        dictionary with a key defined by the "format" field.   The
        leaves of the returned tree of Metadata are then lists with
        common values of "storage_mode" and "format".

        Item 3 above is handled by a related private method called
        `Database._group_by_path`.   It is used in this class to
        handle ensemble file reading as noted in concept 3 above.

    def _load_ensemble_file(self, mdlist, object_type, dir, dfile):
        """
        Private method to efficiently load ensembles stored in a file.

        When reading a ensemble stored in one or more files it is much
        faster to open the file containing multiple records and read
        that file sequentially than using an atomic read for each member
        that would open, seek, read, and close the file for each member.
        This method standardizes reading from a single file when
        the data are stored as raw binary samples (C double floating point).
        It can be used to construct either a SeismogramEnsemble or
        TimeSeriesEnsemble driven by an input list of MongoDB
        documents convert to list of Metadata containers.

        The algorithm runs fast by using a C++ function bound to python
        with pybind11 (_fread_from_file).  For that reason this method
        must ONLY be called for a list with all the data from a single
        file.   The algorithm is designed for speed so it does not verify
        that each entry in mdlist has the same dir and dfile as that
        passed as arguments.   Garbage read or seg faults are nearly
        guaranteed if that is violated and this method is used outside
        the normal use as a component of the chain of private methods used
        by the `Database.read_data` method.  i.e. use this method with
        extreme caution if used for a different application than
        internal use for the Database class.

        The algorithm has to do some fairly weird things to match the
        API of _fread_from_file and to handle the range of errors
        that can happen in this composite read operation.   Some points
        to note for maintenance of this function are:
            1.  This utilizes the newer concept in MsPASS of abortions.
                Any error that invalidates a member ends up putting that
                datum into component[1] of the returned tuple (see below).
                The result is a clean emsembled return in component 0
                meaning it has no dead members.
            2.  For efficiency the algorithm produces a list of
                member index numbers. By that it means the
                member[i] has index value i.  What that means is that
                the array passed to _fread_from_file is a list of i
                values telling the reader in which member slot the
                data are to be loaded.   The list is sorted by foff
                to allow fread to do it's job efficiently because
                buffering makes sequential reads with fread about as fast
                as any io operation possible.  The alternative would
                have been to have _fread_from_file read in i order
                (i.e. a normal loop) but that could involve a lot of
                seeks positions outside the buffer.  Future maintainers
                are warned of this rather odd algorithm, but note it
                was done that way for speed.

        :param mdlist: iterable list of Metadata objects.  These are used
         to create the ensemble members using a feature of the C++ api that
         a skeleton of an atomic object can be created form Metadata alone.
         The sample array is allocated and defined from number of points
         defined in the Metadata container and that is used by fread to
         load the sample data when reading.   Needless to say corrupted
         data for npts or foff are guaranteed trouble.  Other Metadata
         attributes are copied verbatim to the atomic data. If any
         constructors using the Metadata fail the error message is posted

              data that failed during construction for one reason or another.

    """
    Converts a Metadata container to a python dict applying a schema constraints.

    This function is used in all database save operations to guaranteed the
    Metadata container in a mspass data object is consistent with
    requirements for MongDB defined by a specified schema.   It
    dogmatically enforces readonly restrictions in the schema by
    changing the key for any fields marked readonly and found to have
    been set as changed.  Such entries change to "READONLYERROR_" + k
    where k is the original key marked readonly.  See user's manual for
    a discussion of why this is done.

    Other schema constraints are controlled by the setting of mode.
    Mode must be one of "promiscuous","cautious", or "pedantic" or
    the function will raise a MsPASS error marked fatal.   That is the
    only exception this function can throw.  It will never happen when
    used with the Database class method but is possible if a user uses
    this function in a different implementation.

    The contents of the data associated with the md argument (arg0) are assumed
    to have passed through the private database method _sync_metadata_before_update
    before calling this function.  Anyone usingn this function outside the
    Database class should assure a comparable algorithm is not required.

    :param md: contains a Metadata container that is to be converted.
    :type md:  For normal use in mspass md is a larger data object that
      inherits Metadata.  That is, in most uses it is a TimeSeries or

      algorithm should work
    :param save_schema:  The Schema class to be used for constraints
      in building the doc for MongoDB use.  See User's Manual for details
      on how a schema is defined and used in MsPASS.
    :type save_schema:  Schema class
    :param exclude_keys: list of keys (strings) to be excluded from
      the output python dict.   Note "_id" is always excluded to mess
      with required MongoDB usage.  Default is None which means no
      values are excluded.  Note is harmless to list keys that are not
      present in md - does nothing except for a minor cost to test for existence.
    :type exclude_keys: list of strings
    :param mode: Must be one of "promiscuous", "caution", or "pedantic".
      See User's Manual for which to use.  Default is "promiscuous".
      The function will throw MsPASSError exception if not one of the three
      keywords list.
    :type mode: str

    :return:  Result is a returned as a tuple appropriate for the
      normal use of this function inside the Database class.
      The contents of the tuple are:

      0 - python dictionary of edited result ready to save as MongoDB document
      1 - boolean equivalent of the "live" attribute of TimeSeries and Seismogram.
          i.e. if True the result can be considered valid.  If False something
          was very wrong with the input and the contents of 0 is invalid and
          should not be used.  When False the error log in 2 will contain
          one or more error messages.
      2 - An ErrorLogger object that may or may not contain any error logging
          messages.  Callers should call the size method of the this entry
          and handle the list of error messages it contains if size is not zero.
          Note the right way to do that for TimeSeries and Seismogram is to
          use operator += for the elog attribute of the datum.

    """
    This function is more or less the inverse of md2doc.   md2doc is
    needed by writers to convert Metadata to a python dict for saving
    with pymongo.   This function is similarly needed for readers to
    translate MongoDB documents into the Metadata container used by
    MsPASS data objects.

    This function can optionally apply schema constraints using the
    same schema class used by the Database class.  In fact, normal use
    would pass the schema class from the instance of Database that was
    used in loading the document to be converted (arg0).

    This function was built from a skeleton that was originally part of
    the read_data method of Database.  Its behavior for
    differnt modes is inherited from that implementation for backward
    compatibility.  The returns structure is a necessary evil with that
    change in the implementatoin, but is exactly the same as md2doc for
    consistency.

    The way the mode argument is handled is slightly different than
    for md2doc because of the difference in the way this function is
    expected to be used.  This function builds the Metadata container
    that is used in all readers to drive the construction of atomic
    data objects.  See below for a description of what different settings
    of mode.

    :param doc:  document (dict) to be converted to Metadata
    :type doc:  python dict assumed (there is no internal test for efficiency)
    An associative array with string keys operator [] are the main requirements.
    e.g. this function might work with a Metadata container to apply
    schema constraints.

    :param metadata_schema:  instance of MetadataSchema class that can
    optionally be used to impose schema constraints.
    :type metadata_schema:  :class:`mspasspy.db.schema.MetadataSchema`

    :param wfcol:  Collection name from which doc was retrieved.   It should
    normally alreacy be known by the caller so we require it to be passed
    with this required arg.
    :type wfcol:   string

    :param mode: read mode as described in detail in User's Manual.
    Behavior for this function is as follows:
        "promiscuous" - (default)  no checks are applied to any key-value
           pairs and the result is a one-to-one translation of the input.
        "cautious" - Type constraints in the schema are enforced and
          automatically conveted if possible.  If conversion is needed
          and fails the live/dead boolan in the return will be set to
          signal this datum should be killed.  There will also be elog entries.
        "pedantic" - type conversions are strongly enforced.  If any
          type mismatch of a value occurs the live/dead boolean returned
          will be set to signal a kill and there will be one or more
          error messages in the elog return.
    :type mode: string (must match one of the above or the function will throw
        a ValueError exception.

    :return 3-component tuple:  0 = converted Metadata container,
      1 - boolean equivalent to "live".  i.e. if True the results is valid
      while if False constructing an object from the result is ill advised,
      2 - ErrorLogger object containing in error messages.  Callers should
        test if the result of the size method of the return is > 0 and
        handle the error messages as desired.

    This function is more or less a translator to create a list of
    subclasses of the BasicMatcher class used for generic normalization.
    The input list (input_nlist) can be one of two things.  If the
    list is a set of strings the strings are assumed to define
    collection names.  It then constructs a database-driven
    matcher class using the ObjectId method that is the stock
    MongoDB indexing method.   Specifically, for each collection
    name it creates an instance of the generic ObjectIdDBMatcher
    class pointing to the named collection.   The other allowed
    type for the members of the input list are children of the
    base class called `BasicMatcher` defined in spasspy.db.normalize.
    `BasicMatcher` abstracts the task required for normalization
    and provides a generic mechanism to load normalization data
    including data defined outside of MongoDB (e.g. a pandas DataFrame).
    If the list contains anything but a string or a child of
    BasicMatcher the function will abort throwing a TypeError
    exception.  On success it returns a list of children of
    `BasicMatcher` that can be used to normalize any wf
    document retried from MongoDB assuming the matching
