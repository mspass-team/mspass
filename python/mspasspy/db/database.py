    """
    MsPASS core database handle.  All MongoDB database operation in MsPASS
    should utilize this object.  This object is a subclass of the
    Database class of pymongo.  It extends the class in several ways
    fundamental to the MsPASS framework:

    1. It abstracts read and write operations for seismic data managed
       by the framework.   Note reads and writes are for atomic objects.
       Use the distributed read and write functions for parallel handling of
       complete data sets.
    2. It contains methods for managing the most common seismic Metadata
       (namely source and receiver geometry and receiver response data).
    3. It adds a schema that can (optionally) be used to enforce type
       requirements and/or provide aliasing.
    4. Manages error logging data.
    5. Manages (optional) processing history data

    The class currently has only one constructor normally called with
    a variant of the following:
      db=Database(dbclient,'mydatabase')
    where dbclient is either a MongoDB database client instance or
    (recommended) the MsPASS DBClient wrapper (a subclass of the
    pymongo client).  The second argument is the database "name"
    passed to the MongoDB server that defines your working database.
    Optional parameters are:

    :param schema: a :class:`str` of the yaml file name that defines
      both the database schema and the metadata schema. If this parameter
      is set, it will override the following two.
    :param db_schema: Set the name for the database schema to use with this
      handle.  Default is the MsPASS schema. (See User's Manual for details)
    :param md_schema:  Set the name for the Metadata schema.   Default is
      the MsPASS definitions.  (see User's Manual for details)

    As a subclass of pymongo Database the constructor accepts any
    parameters defined for the base class (see pymongo documentation)

        This is the core MsPASS reader for constructing Seismogram or TimeSeries
        objects from data managed with MondoDB through MsPASS.   It is the
        core reader for serial processing where a typical algorithm would be:

          query= { ... properly constructed MondoDB query or just '{}'}
          cursor=db.collection.find(query)  # collection is wf_TimeSeries or wf_Seismogram

            d=db.read_data(id)
              ...   # additional processing here

        The above loop will construct one Seismogram or TimeSeries (depending on
        which collection is referenced) for handling within the for loop.
        Use the read_distributed_data function to read a dataset for
        parallel processing.  This function is designed to handle one atomic
        object at a time.  It is, in fact, called in read_distributed_data
        Optional parameters control read behavior and additional options
        not always needed.  An important one for handling reads from a
        a dataset saved partway through a workflow is data_tag.

        :param object_id: MongoDB object id of the wf document to be constructed from
          data defined in the database.  The object id is guaranteed unique and provides
          a unique link to a unique document or nothing.   In the later case the
          function will return a None.
        :type cursor: :class:`pymongo.cursor.CursorType`
        :param mode: reading mode that controls how the function interacts with
          the schema definition for the data type.   Must be one of
          ['promiscuous','cautious','pedantic'].   See user's manual for a
          detailed description of what the modes mean.  Default is 'promiscuous'
          which turns off all schema checks and loads all attributes defined for
          each object read.
        :type mode: :class:`str`
        :param normalize: list of collections that are to used for data
          normalization. (see User's manual and MongoDB documentation for
          details on this concept)  Briefly normalization means common
          metadata like source and receiver geometry are defined in separate
          smaller collections that are linked through this mechanism
          during reads. Default uses no normalization.
        :type normalize: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param load_history: boolean (True or False) switch used to enable or
          disable object level history mechanism.   When set True each datum
          will be tagged with its origin id that defines the leaf nodes of a
          history G-tree.  See the User's manual for additional details of this
          feature.  Default is False.
        :param exclude_keys: Sometimes it is helpful to remove one or more
          attributes stored in the database from the data's Metadata (header)
          so they will not cause problems in downstream processing.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection:  Specify an alternate collection name to
          use for reading the data.  The default sets the collection name
          based on the data type and automatically loads the correct schema.
          The collection listed must be defined in the schema and satisfy
          the expectations of the reader.  This is an advanced option that
          is indended only to simplify extensions to the reader.
        :param data_tag:  The definition of a dataset can become ambiguous
          when partially processed data are saved within a workflow.   A common
          example would be windowing long time blocks of data to shorter time
          windows around a particular seismic phase and saving the windowed data.
          The windowed data can be difficult to distinguish from the original
          with standard queries.  For this reason we make extensive use of "tags"
          for save and read operations to improve the efficiency and simplify
          read operations.   Default turns this off by setting the tag null (None).
        :type data_tag: :class:`str`
        :param alg_name: alg_name is the name the func we are gonna save while preserving the history.
        :type alg_name: :class:`str`

        Use this method to save an atomic data object (TimeSeries or Seismogram)
        to be managed with MongoDB.  The Metadata are stored as documents in
        a MongoDB collection.  The waveform data can be stored in a conventional
        file system or in MongoDB's gridfs system.   At the time this docstring
        was written testing was still in progress to establish the relative
        performance of file system io versus gridfs, but our working hypothesis
        is the answer of which is faster will be configuration dependent. In
        either case the goal of this function is to make a save operation as
        simple as possible by abstracting the complications involved in
        the actual save.

        Any errors messages held in the object being saved are always
        written to documents in MongoDB is a special collection defined in
        the schema.   Saving object level history is optional.

        There are multiple options described below.  One worth emphasizing is
        "data_tag".   Such a tag is essential for intermediate saves of
        a dataset if there is no other unique way to distinguish the
        data in is current state from data saved earlier.  For example,
        consider a job that did nothing but read waveform segments spanning
        a long time period (e.g. day files),cutting out a shorter time window,
        and then saving windowed data.  Crafting an unambiguous query to
        find only the windowed data in that situation could be challenging
        or impossible.  Hence, we recommend a data tag always be used for
        most saves.

        The mode parameter needs to be understood by all users of this
        function.  All modes enforce a schema constraint for "readonly"
        attributes.   An immutable (readonly) attribute by definition
        should not be changed during processing.   During a save
        all attributes with a key defined as readonly are tested
        with a method in the Metadata container that keeps track of
        any Metadata changes.  If a readonly attribute is found to
        have been changed it will be renamed with the prefix
        "READONLYERROR_", saved, and an error posted (e.g. if you try
        to alter site_lat (a readonly attribute) in a workflow when
        you save the waveform you will find an entry with the key
        READONERROR_site_lat.)   In the default 'promiscuous' mode
        all other attributes are blindly saved to the database as
        name value pairs with no safeties.  In 'cautious' mode we
        add a type check.  If the actual type of an attribute does not
        match what the schema expect, this method will try to fix the
        type error before saving the data.  If the conversion is
        successful it will be saved with a complaint error posted
        to elog.  If it fails, the attribute will not be saved, an
        additional error message will be posted, and the save
        algorithm continues.  In 'pedantic' mode, in contrast, all
        type errors are considered to invalidate the data.
        Similar error messages to that in 'cautious' mode are posted
        but any type errors will cause the datum passed as arg 0
        to be killed. The lesson is saves can leave entries that
        may need to be examined in elog and when really bad will
        cause the datum to be marked dead after the save.

        This method can throw an exception but only for errors in
        usage (i.e. arguments defined incorrectly)

        :param mspass_object: the object you want to save.
        :type mspass_object: either :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` or :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`
        :param mode: This parameter defines how attributes defined with
          key-value pairs in MongoDB documents are to be handled on reading.
          By "to be handled" we mean how strongly to enforce name and type
          specification in the schema for the type of object being constructed.
          Options are ['promiscuous','cautious','pedantic'] with 'promiscuous'
          being the default.  See the User's manual for more details on
          the concepts and how to use this option.
        :type mode: :class:`str`
        :param storage_mode: Must be either "gridfs" or "file.  When set to
          "gridfs" the waveform data are stored internally and managed by
          MongoDB.  If set to "file" the data will be stored in a file system
          with the dir and dfile arguments defining a file name.   The
          default is "gridfs".
        :type storage_mode: :class:`str`
        :param dir: file directory for storage.  This argument is ignored if
          storage_mode is set to "gridfs".  When storage_mode is "file" it
          sets the directory in a file system where the data should be saved.
          Note this can be an absolute or relative path.  If the path is
          relative it will be expanded with the standard python library
          path functions to a full path name for storage in the database
          document with the attribute "dir".  As for any io we remind the
          user that you much have write permission in this directory.
          The writer will also fail if this directory does not already
          exist.  i.e. we do not attempt to
        :type dir: :class:`str`
        :param dfile: file name for storage of waveform data.  As with dir
          this parameter is ignored if storage_mode is "gridfs" and is
          required only if storage_mode is "file".   Note that this file
          name does not have to be unique.  The writer always calls positions
          the write pointer to the end of the file referenced and sets the
          attribute "foff" to that position. That allows automatic appends to
          files without concerns about unique names.

          `supported formats <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.write.html#supported-formats>`__
          of ObsPy writer. The default the python None which the method
          assumes means to store the data in its raw binary form.  The default
          should normally be used for efficiency.  Alternate formats are
          primarily a simple export mechanism.  See the User's manual for
          more details on data export.  Used only for "file" storage mode.
        :type format: :class:`str`
        :param overwrite:  If true gridfs data linked to the original
          waveform will be replaced by the sample data from this save.
          Default is false, and should be the normal use.  This option
          should never be used after a reduce operator as the parents
          are not tracked and the space advantage is likely minimal for
          the confusion it would cause.   This is most useful for light, stable
          preprocessing with a set of map operators to regularize a data
          set before more extensive processing.  It can only be used when
          storage_mode is set to gridfs.
        :type overwrite:  boolean
        :param exclude_keys: Metadata can often become contaminated with
          attributes that are no longer needed or a mismatch with the data.
          A type example is the bundle algorithm takes three TimeSeries
          objects and produces a single Seismogram from them.  That process
          can, and usually does, leave things like seed channel names and
          orientation attributes (hang and vang) from one of the components
          as extraneous baggage.   Use this of keys to prevent such attributes
          from being written to the output documents.  Not if the data being
          saved lack these keys nothing happens so it is safer, albeit slower,
          to have the list be as large as necessary to eliminate any potential
          debris.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection: The default for this parameter is the python
          None.  The default should be used for all but data export functions.
          The normal behavior is for this writer to use the object
          data type to determine the schema is should use for any type or
          name enforcement.  This parameter allows an alernate collection to
          be used with or without some different name and type restrictions.
          The most common use of anything other than the default is an
          export to a diffrent format.
        :param data_tag: a user specified "data_tag" key.  See above and
          User's manual for guidance on how the use of this option.
        :type data_tag: :class:`str`

        This method can be used to fix a subset of common database problems

        are defined as those that are identified by the "dbverify" command
        line tool or it's Database equivalent (the verify method of this class).
        This method is an alternative to the command line tool dbverify.  Use
        this method for more surgical fixes that require a query to limit
        the application of the fix.

          or mark some or all data dead.  On the other hand, undefined data may
          contain important information you need that for some reason is
          not defined in the schema.  In that case do not run this method to

        document in normalization collection.   By default this

        the documents that had errors.  This function is used in the
        verify standalone program that acts as a front end to tests
        in this module.  The function can be run in independently

        entire wf collection.
        :param verbose:  when True errors will be printed.  By default
        the function works silently and you should use the output to
        interact with any errors returned.
        :param error_limit: Is a sanity check on the number of errors logged.
        Errors of any type are limited to this number (default 1000).
        The idea is errors should be rare and if this number is exceeded
        you have a big problem you need to fix before scanning again.

        This function checks the integrity of all attributes

        data with a key that is not recognized.  Both tests are necessary

        about type and exactly what goes into a document.  MongoDB pretty
        much allow type it knows about to be associated with any key
        you choose.   In MsPASS we need to enforce some type restrictions

        most useful in an interactive python session where the function

        as part of tests driven by the dbverify program.

        Use this method if you want to save the output of a processing algorithm
        whose output is only posted to metadata.   That can be something as
        simple as a little python function that does some calculations on other
        metadata field, or as elaborate as a bound FORTRAN or C/C++ function
        that computes something, posts the results to Metadata, but doesn't
        actually alter the sample data.   A type example of the later is an amplitude
        calculation that posts the computed amplitude to some metadata key value.

        This method will ONLY attempt to update Metadata attributes stored in the
        data passed (mspass_object) that have been marked as having been
        changed since creation of the data object.  The default mode will
        check entries against the schema and attempt to fix any type
        mismatches (mode=='cautious' for this algorithm).  In cautious or
        pedantic mode this method can end up posting a lot of errors in
        elog for data object (mspass_object) being handled.  In
        promiscuous mode there are no safeties and the any values
        that are defined in Metadata as having been changed will be
        posted as an update to the parent wf document to the data object.

        A feature of the schema that is considered an unbreakable rule is
        that any attribute marked "readonly" in the schema cannot by
        definition be updated with this method.  It utilizes the same
        method for handling this as the save_data method.  That is,
        for all "mode" parameters if an key is defined in the schema as
        readonly and it is listed as having been modified, it will
        be save with a new key creating by adding the prefix
        "READONLYERROR_" .  e.g. if we had a site_sta read as
        'AAK' but we changed it to 'XYZ' in a workflow, when we tried
        to save the data you will find an entry in the document
        of {'READONLYERROR_site_sta' : 'XYZ'}

        :param mspass_object: the object you want to update.
        :type mspass_object: either :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` or :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`
        :param exclude_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to exclude from being updated.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param force_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to force
         to be updated.   Normally this method will only update attributes
         that have been marked as changed since creation of the parent data
         object.  If data with these keys is found in the mspass_object they
         will be added to the update record.
        :type force_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection: the collection name you want to use. If not specified, use the defined collection in the metadata schema.
        :param mode: This parameter defines how attributes defines how
          strongly to enforce schema constraints. As described above
          'promiscuous' justs updates all changed values with no schema
          tests.  'cautious', the default, enforces type constraints and
          tries to convert easily fixed type mismatches (e.g. int to floats
          of vice versa).  Both 'cautious' and 'pedantic' may leave one or
          more complaint message in the elog of mspass_object on how the
          method did or did not fix mismatches with the schema.  Both
          also will drop any key-value pairs where the value cannot be
          converted to the type defined in the schema.

        :type mode: :class:`str`
        :param alg_name: alg_name is the name the func we are gonna save while preserving the history.
        :type alg_name: :class:`str`
        :param alg_id: alg_id is a unique id to record the usage of func while preserving the history.
        :type alg_id: :class:`bson.objectid.ObjectId`
        :return: mspass_object data.  Normally this is an unaltered copy
          of the data passed through mspass_object.  If there are errors,
          however, the elog will contain new messages.  Note any such
          messages are volatile and will not be saved to the database
          until the save_data method is called.

        Updates both metadata and sample data corresponding to an input data
        object.

        Since storage of data objects in MsPASS is broken into multiple
        collections and storage methods, doing a full data update has some
        complexity.   This method handles the problem differently for the
        different pieces:
            1. An update is performed on the parent wf collection document.
               That update makes use of the related Database method
               called update_metadata.
            2. If the error log is not empty it is saved.
            3. If the history container has contents it is saved.
            4. The sample data is the thorniest problem. Currently this
               method will only do sample updates for data stored in
               the mongodb gridfs system.   With files containing multiple
               waveforms it would be necessary to append to the files and
               this could create a blaat problem with large data sets so
               we do not currently support that type of update.

        :param mspass_object: the object you want to update.
        :type mspass_object: either :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.TimeSeries` or :class:`mspasspy.ccore.seismic.Seismogram`
        :param exclude_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to exclude from being updated.
        :type exclude_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param force_keys: a list of metadata attributes you want to force
         to be updated.   Normally this method will only update attributes
         that have been marked as changed since creation of the parent data
         object.  If data with these keys is found in the mspass_object they
         will be added to the update record.
        :type force_keys: a :class:`list` of :class:`str`
        :param collection: the collection name you want to use. If not specified, use the defined collection in the metadata schema.
        :param mode: This parameter defines how attributes defines how
          strongly to enforce schema constraints. As described above
          'promiscuous' justs updates all changed values with no schema
          tests.  'cautious', the default, enforces type constraints and
          tries to convert easily fixed type mismatches (e.g. int to floats
          of vice versa).  Both 'cautious' and 'pedantic' may leave one or
          more complaint message in the elog of mspass_object on how the
          method did or did not fix mismatches with the schema.  Both
          also will drop any key-value pairs where the value cannot be
          converted to the type defined in the schema.
        :type mode: :class:`str`

          of the data passed through mspass_object.  If there are errors,
          however, the elog will contain new messages.  All such messages,
          howevever, should be saved in the elog collection because elog

        Save an Ensemble container of a group of data objecs to MongoDB.

        Ensembles are a core concept in MsPASS that are a generalization of
        fixed "gather" types frozen into every seismic reflection processing
        system we know of.   This is is a writer for data stored in such a
        container.  It is little more than a loop over each "member" of the
        ensemble calling the Database.save_data method for each member.
        For that reason most of the arguments are passed downstream directly
        to save_data.   See the save_data method and the User's manual for
        more verbose descriptions of their behavior and expected use.

        The only complexity in handling an ensemble is that our implementation
        has a separate Metadata container associated with the overall group
        that is assumed to be constant for every member of the ensemble.  For this
        reason before entering the loop calling save_data on each member
        the method calls the objects sync_metadata method that copies (overwrites if
        previously defined) the ensemble attributes to each member.  That assure
        atomic saves will not lose their association with a unique ensemble
        indexing scheme.

        A final feature of note is that an ensemble can be marked dead.

        immediately and does nothing.

        Delete is one of the basic operations any database system should

        nontrivial with seismic data stored with the model used in MsPASS.
        The reason is that the content of the objects are spread between
        multiple collections and sometimes use storage in files completely
        outside MongoDB.   This method, however, is designed to handle that
        and when given the object id defining a document in one of the wf
        collections, it will delete the wf document entry and manage the
        waveform data.  If the data are stored in gridfs the deletion of
        the waveform data will be immediate.  If the data are stored in
        disk files the file will be deleted when there are no more references
        in the wf collection for the exact combination of dir and dfile associated
        an atomic deletion.  Error log and history data deletion linked to
        a datum is optional.

        """
        Saves contents of all components of an obspy inventory
        object to documents in the site and channel collections.
        The site collection is sufficient for Seismogram objects but
        TimeSeries data will normally need to be connected to the
        channel collection.   The algorithm used will not add
        duplicates based on the following keys:

        For site:
            net
            sta
            chan
            loc
            starttime::endtime - this check is done cautiously with
              a 10 s fudge factor to avoid the issue of floating point
              equal tests.   Probably overly paranoid since these
              fields are normally rounded to a time at the beginning
              of a utc day, but small cost to pay for stabilty because
              this function is not expected to be run millions of times
              on a huge collection.

        for channels:
            net
            sta
            chan
            loc
            starttime::endtime - same approach as for site with same
               issues - note especially 10 s fudge factor.   This is
               necessary because channel metadata can change more
               frequently than site metadata (e.g. with a sensor
               orientation or sensor swap)

        The channel collection can contain full response data
        that can be obtained by extracting the data with the key
        "serialized_inventory" and running pickle loads on the returned
        string.

        A final point of note is that not all Inventory objects are created
        equally.   Inventory objects appear to us to be designed as an image
        of stationxml data.  The problem is that stationxml, like SEED, has to
        support a lot of complexity faced by data centers that end users
        like those using this package do not need or want to know.   The
        point is this method tries to untangle the complexity and aims to reduce the
        result to a set of documents in the site and channel collection
        that can be cross referenced to link the right metadata with all
        waveforms in a dataset.

        The channel collection is assumed to have a one to one
        mapping of net:sta:loc:chan:starttime - endtime.
        This method uses a restricted query to match the
        keys given and returns the document matching the specified keys.

        The optional loc code is handled specially.  The reason is
        that it is common to have the loc code empty.  In seed data that
        puts two ascii blank characters in the 2 byte packet header
        position for each miniseed blockette.  With pymongo that
        can be handled one of three ways that we need to handle gracefully.
        That is, one can either set a literal two blank character
        string, an empty string (""), or a MongoDB NULL.   To handle
        that confusion this algorithm first queries for all matches
        without loc defined.  If only one match is found that is
        returned immediately.  If there are multiple matches we
        search though the list of docs returned for a match to
        loc being conscious of the null string oddity.

        The (optional) time arg is used for a range match to find
        period between the site startime and endtime.  If not used
        the first occurence will be returned (usually ill adivsed)
        Returns None if there is no match.  Although the time argument
        is technically option it usually a bad idea to not include
        a time stamp because most stations saved as seed data have
        time variable channel metadata.

        This is the first stage import function for handling the import of
        miniseed data.  This function scans a data file defined by a directory
        (dir arg) and dfile (file name) argument.  I builds an index
        for the file and writes the index to mongodb
        in the collection defined by the collection
        argument (wf_miniseed by default).   The index is bare bones
        miniseed tags (net, sta, chan, and loc) with a starttime tag.
        The index is appropriate ONLY if the data on the file are created
        by concatenating data with packets sorted by net, sta, loc, chan, time
        AND the data are contiguous in time.   The original
        concept for this function came from the need to handle large files
        produced by concanentation of miniseed single-channel files created
        by obpsy's mass_downloader.   i.e. the basic model is the input
        files are assumed to be something comparable to running the unix
        cat command on a set of single-channel, contingous time sequence files.
        There are other examples that do the same thing (e.g. antelope's
        miniseed2days).

        We emphasize this function only builds an index - it does not
        convert any data.   It has to scan the entire file deriving the
        index from data retrieved from miniseed packets with libmseed so
        for large data sets this can take a long time.

        Actual seismic data stored as miniseed are prone to time tears.
        That can happen at the instrument level in at least two common
        ways: (1) dropped packets from telemetry issues, or (2) instrument
        timing jumps when a clock loses external lock to gps or some
        other standard and the rock is restored.  The behavior is this
        function is controlled by the input parameter
        segment_time_tears.  When true a new index entry is created
        any time the start time of a packet differs from that computed
        from the endtime of the last packet by more than one sample
        AND net:sta:chan:loc are constant.  The default for this
        parameter is false because data with many dropped packets from
        telemetry are common and can create overwhelming numbers of
        index entries quickly.  When false the scan only creates a new
        index record when net, sta, chan, or loc change between successive
        packets.  Our reader has gap handling functions to handle
        time tears.  Set segment_time_tears true only when you are
        confident the data set does not contain a large number of dropped
        packets.

        Note to parallelize this function put a list of files in a Spark
        RDD or a Dask bag and parallelize the call the this function.
        That can work because MongoDB is designed for parallel operations
        and we use the thread safe version of the libmseed reader.

        Finally, note that cross referencing with the channel and/or
        source collections should be a common step after building the
        index with this function.  The reader found elsewhere in this
        module will transfer linking ids (i.e. channel_id and/or source_id)
        to TimeSeries objects when it reads the data from the files
        indexed by this function.

        :param dfile:  file name of data to be indexed.  Asssumed to be
          the leaf node of the path - i.e. it contains no directory information
          but just the file name.
        :param dir:  directory name.  This can be a relative path from the
          current directory be be advised it will always be converted to an
          fully qualified path.  If it is undefined (the default) the function
          assumes the file is in the current working directory and will use
          the result of the python getcwd command as the directory path
          stored in the database.
        :param collection:  is the mongodb collection name to write the
          index data to.  The default is 'wf_miniseed'.  It should be rare
          to use anything but the default.
        :param segment_time_tears: boolean controlling handling of data gaps
          defined by constant net, sta, chan, and loc but a discontinuity
          in time tags for successive packets.  See above for a more extensive
          discussion of how to use this parameter.  Default is True.
        :param elog_collection:  name to write any error logs messages
          from the miniseed reader.  Default is "elog", which is the
          same as for TimeSeries and Seismogram data, but the cross reference
          keys here are keyed by "wf_miniseed_id".
        :param return_ids:  if set True the function will return a tuple
          with two id lists.  The 0 entry is an array of ids from the
          collection (wf_miniseed by default) of index entries saved and
          the 1 entry will contain the ids in the elog_collection of
          error log entry insertions.  The 1 entry will be empty if the
          reader found no errors and the error log was empty (the hopefully
          normal situation).  When this argument is False (the default) it
          returns None.  Set true if you need to build some kind of cross
          reference to read errors to build some custom cleaning method
          for specialized processing that can be done more efficiently.
          By default it is fast only to associate an error log entry with
          a particular waveform index entry. (we store the saved index
          MongoDB document id with each elog entry)
        :param normalize_channel:  boolean controlling normalization with
          the channel collection.   When set True (default is false) the
          method will call the Database.get_seed_channel method, extract
          the id from the result, and set the result as "channel_id" before
          writing the wf_miniseed document.  Set this argument true if
          you have a relatively complete channel collection assembled
          before running a workflow to index a set of miniseed files
          (a common raw data starting point).
        :param verbose:  boolean passed to get_seed_channel.  This
          argument has no effect unless normalize_channel is set True.
          It is necessary because the get_seed_channel function has no
          way to log errors except calling print.  A very common metadata
          error is duplicate and/or time overlaps in channel metadata.
          Those are usually harmless so the default for this parameter is
          False.  Set this True if you are using inline normalization
          (normalize_channel set True) and you aren't certain your
          channel collection has no serious inconsistencies.
        :exception: This function can throw a range of error types for
          a long list of possible io issues.   Callers should use a
          generic handler to avoid aborts in a large job.

        columns in the input table or this function will throw a MsPASSError

        function will assume the line specified by the "header_line" argument as
        column headers defining the attribute name.  If header_line is less
        than 0 this argument will be required.  When header_line is >= 0

        keyed by names matching those defined in the file or attribute_names
        array (i.e. the panda/dataframe column index names) and values defining

        attribute names that define the subset of the dataframe dataframe
        attributes that are to be saved.  For relational db users this is
        effectively a "select" list of attribute names.  The default is
