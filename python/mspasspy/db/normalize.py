    """
    Base class defining the api for a generic matching capability for
    MongoDB normalization.   The base class is a skeleton that
    defines on required abstract methods and initializes a set of
    universal attributes all matchers need.  It cannot be instatiated directly.

    Matching is defined as one of two things:  (1)  a one-to-one
    match algorithm is guaranteed to have each search yield either
    exactly one match or none.  That is defined through a find_one
    method following the same concept in MongoDB.  (2) some
    matches are not unique and yield more than one document.
    For that case use the find method.  Unlike the MongoDB
    find method, however, find in this context returns a list of
    Metadata containers holding the set of attributes requested
    in lists defined on constuction.

    Another way of viewing this interface, in fact, is an abstraction of
    the find and find_one methods of MongoDB to a wider class of
    algorithms that may or may not utilize MongoDB directly.
    In particular, intermediate level classes defined below that implement
    different cache data structures allow input either by
    loading data from a MongoDB collection of from a pandas DataFrame.
    That can potentially provide a wide variety of applications of
    matching data to tabular data contained in files loaded into
    pandas by any of long list of standard dataframe read methods.
    Examples are any SQL database or antelope raw tables or views
    loaded as text files.

class DictionaryCacheMatcher(BasicMatcher):
    """
    Matcher implementing a caching method based on a python dictionary.

    This is an intermediate class for instances where the database collection
    to be matched is small enough that the in-memory model is appropriate.
    It should also only be used if the matching algorithm can be reduced
    to a single string that can serve as a unique id for each tuple.

    The class defines a generic dictionary cache with a string key.   The way that
    key is define is abstracted through two virtual methods:
    (1) The cache_id method creates a match key from a mspass data object.
        That is normally from the Metadata container but it is not
        restricted to that. e.g. start time for TimeSeries or
        Seismogram objects can be obtained from the t0 attribute
        directly.
    (2) The db_make_cache_id is called by the internal method of this
        intermediate class (method name is _load_normalization_cache)
        to build the cache index from MongoDB documents scanned to
        construct the cache.

    Two different methods to define the cache index are necessary as a
    generic way to implement aliases.  A type example is the mspass use
    of names like "channel_id" to refer to the ObjectId of a specific
    document in the channel collection.   When loading channel the name
    key is "_id" but data objects would normally have that same data
    defined with the key "channel_id".   Similarly, if data have had
    aliases applied a key in the data may not match the name in a
    collection to be matched.   The dark side of this is it is very
    easy when running subclasses of this to get null results with
    all members of a dataset.   As always testing with a subset of
    data is strongly recommended before running versions of this on
    a large dataset.

    Matcher implementing a caching method based on a Pandas DataFrame

    to be matched is small enough that the in-memory model is appropriate.
    It should be used when the matching algorithm is readily cast into the
    subsetting api of a pandas DataFrame.

    The constructor of this intermediate class first calls the BasicMatcher
    (base class) constructor to initialize some common attribute including
    the critical lists of attributes to be loaded.   This constructor then
    creates the internal DataFrame cache by one of two methods.
    If arg0 is a MongoDB database handle it loads the data in the
    named collection to a DataFrame created during construction.  If the
    input is a DataFrame already it is simply copied selecting only
    columns defined by the attributes_to_load and load_if_defined lists.
    There is also an optional parameter, custom_null_values, that is a
    python dictionary defining values in a field that should be treated
    as a definition of a Null for that field.  The constuctor converts
    such values to a standard pandas null field value.

    This class implements generic find and find_one methods.
    Subclasses of this class must implement a "subset" method to be
    concrete.  A subset method is the abstract algorithm that defines

     it a panda?)  See concrete subclasses for examples.

class MiniseedDBMatcher(DatabaseMatcher):
    """
    Database implementation of matcher for miniseed data using
    SEED keys net:sta:chan(channel only):loc and a time interval test.
    Miniseed data uses the exessively complex key that combines four unique
    string names (net, sta, chan, and loc) and a time interval
    of operation to define a unique set of station metadata for each
    channel.  In mspass we also create the site collection without the
    chan attribute.  This implementation works for both channel and
    site under control of the collection argument.

    This case is the complete opposite of something like the ObjectId
    matcher above as the match query we need to generate is
    excessively long requiring up to 6 fields.

    The default collection name is channel which is the only
    correct use if applied to data created through readers applied to
    wf_miniseed.   The implementation can also work on Seismogram
    data if and only if the channel argument is then set to "site".
    The difference is that for Seismogram data "chan" is a
    undefined concept.  In both cases the keys and content assume the mspass
    schema for the channel or site collections.  The constructor will
    throw a MsPASSError exception if the collection argument is
    anything but "channel" or "site" to enforce this limitation.
    If you use a schema other than the mspass schema the methods in
    this class will fail if you change any of the following keys:
        net, sta, chan, loc, starttime, endtime, hang, vang

    Users should only call
    the find_one method for this application.   The find_one algorithm
    first queries for any matches of net:sta:chan(channel only):loc(optional) and
    data t0 within the startime and endtime of the channel document
    attributes (an interval match).  That combination should yield
    either 1 or no matches if the channel collection is clean.
    However, there are known issues with station metadata that can
    cause multiple matches in unusual cases (Most notably overlapping
    time intervals defined for the same channel.)  The find_one method
    will handle that case returning the first one found and posting an
    error message that should be handled by the caller.

    Instantiation of this class is a call to the superclass
    constructor with specialized defaults and wrapper code to
    automatically handle potential mismatches between site and channel.
    The arguments for the constructor follow:

class MiniseedMatcher(DictionaryCacheMatcher):
    """
    Cached version of matcher for miniseed station/channel Metadata.

    Miniseed data require 6 keys to uniquely define a single channel
    of data (5 at the Seismogram level where the channels are merged).
    A further complication for using the DictionaryCacheMatcher interface is
    that part of the definition is a UTC time interval defining when the
    metadata is valid.  We handle that in this implementation by
    implementing a two stage search algorithm for the find_one method.
    First, the cache index is defined by a unique string created from
    the four string keys of miniseed that the MsPASS default schema
    refers to with the keywords net, sta, chan, and loc.
    At this point in time we know of no examples of a seismic instrument
    where the number of distinct time intervals with different Metadata
    are huge so the secondary search is a simple linear search through
    the python list return by the generic find method using only the
    net, sta, chan, and loc keys as the index.

    The default collection name is channel which is the only
    correct use if applied to data created through readers applied to
    wf_miniseed.   The implementation can also work on Seismogram
    data if and only if the channel argument is then set to "site".
    The difference is that for Seismogram data "chan" is a
    undefined concept.  In both cases the keys and content assume the mspass
    schema for the channel or site collections.  The constructor will
    throw a MsPASSError exception if the collection argument is
    anything but "channel" or "site" to enforce this limitation.
    If you use a schema other than the mspass schema the methods in
    this class will fail if you change any of the following keys:
        net, sta, chan, loc, starttime, endtime, hang, vang

    Users should only call the find_one method for this application.
    The find_one method here overrides the generic find_one in the
    superclass DictionaryCacheMatcher.  It implements the linear search for a
    matching time interval test as noted above.  Note also this
    class does not support Ensembles directly.   Matching instrument
    data is by definition what we call atomic. If you are processing
    ensembles you will need to write a small wrapper function that
    would run find_one and handle the out looping over each member of
    the ensemble.

      Default ["_id","lat","lon","elev","hang","vang"]
               "hang","vang","starttime","endtime"]
      when collection is set as channel.  Smaller list of
      ["_id","lat","lon","elev"] is
      default when collection is set as "site".  In either case the
      list MUST contain "starttime" and "endtime".  The reason is the
      linear search step will always use those two fields in the linear
      search for a time interval match. Be careful in how endtime is defined
      that resolves to an epoch time in the distant future and not some
      null database attribute; a possible scenario with DataFrame
      input but not a concern if using mspass loaders from StationML data.

      Note there is also an implicit assumption that the keys "net" and
      "sta" are always defined.  "chan" must also be defined if the
      collection name is "channel".  "loc" is handled as optional for
      database input but required if the input is via a Dataframe

class EqualityMatcher(DataFrameCacheMatcher):
    """
    Match with an equality test for the values of one or more keys
    with possible aliasing between data keys and database keys.

    This class can be used for matching a set of keys that together
    provide a unique matching capability.   Note the keys are
    applied sequentially to reduce the size of internal DataFrame
    cache in stages.  If the DataFrame is large it may improve performance
    if the most unique key in a series appears first.

    A special feature of the implementation is that we allow
    what is best thought of as reverse aliasing for the keys to
    be used for matching.   That is, the base class of this family
    has an attribute self.aliases that allow mapping from collection names
    to data object names.  The match_keys parameter here is done in
    the reverse order.  That is, the key of the match_keys dictionary
    is the data object key while the value associated with that key
    is the DataFrame column name to match.  The constructor of the
    class does a sanity check to verify the two are consistent.
    The constructor will throw an exception if the two dictionaries
    are inconstent.  Note that means if you use an actual alias through
    match_keys (i.e. the key and value are different) you must define
    the aliases dictionary with the same combination reversed.
    (e.g.  matchkeys={"KSTA":"sta"} requires aliases={"sta":"KSTA"})

    :param db_or_df:  MongoDB database handle or a pandas DataFrame.
      Most users will use the database handle version.   In that case
      the collection argument is used to determine what collection is
      loaded into the cache.   If using a DataFrame is used the
      collection name is only a tag defined by the user.   For a
      DataFrame a column index is required that contains at least
      the attributes defined in attribute_to_load.
    :type db_or_df: MongoDB database handle or pandas DataFrame.

    :param collection:  When using database input this is expected to be
      a string defining a valid MongoDB collection with documents that are
      to be scanned and loaded into the internal cache.  With DataFrame input
      this string is only a tag.  It is relevant then only if the
      prepend_collection_name boolean is set True.  There is no default

    :type collection: string

    :param match_keys:  python dict of keys that are to be used for

      attribute.  (a typical common example would be something like
      "source_lat" in the data matching "lat" in the source collection).
      The key for each entry in this dict is taken as the key for the

    :param query:  optional query to apply to collection before loading
      data from the database.  This parameter is ignored if the input
      is a DataFrame.  A common use would be to reduce the size of the
      cache by using a time range limit on station metadata to only
      load records relevant to the dataset being processed.  This
      parameter is currently ignored for DataFrame input as we assume
      pandas subsetting would be used for the same functionality
      in the workflow prior to calling the class constructor for this object.
    :type query:  python dictionary.

    :param load_if_defined: list of keys of optional attributes to be
      extracted by find method.  Any data attached to these keys will only

     when fetching from a data object's Metadata container.   The key sense
     of the mapping is important to keep straight.  The key of this
     dictionary should match one  of the attributes in attributes_to_load
     or load_if_defined.  The value the key defines should be the alias
     used to fetch the comparable attribute from the data.

class OriginTimeDBMatcher(DatabaseMatcher):
    """
    Generic class to match data by comparing a time defined in data to an
    origin time using a database query algorithm.

    The default behavior of this matcher class is to match data to
    source documents based on origin time with an optional time offset.
    Conceptually the data model for this matching is identical to conventional
    multichannel shot gathers where the start time is usually the origin time.
    It is also a common model for downloaded source oriented waveform
    segments from FDSN web services with obspy.  Obspy has an example
    in their documentation for how to download data defined exactly this way.
    In that mode we match each source document that matches a projected
    origin time within a specified tolerance. Specifically, let t0
    be the start time extracted from the data.  We then compute the
    projected, test origin time as test_otime = t0 - t0offset.
    Note the sign convention that a positive offset means the time t0
    is after the event origin time.   We then select all source
    records for which the time field satisifies:
        source.time - tolerance <= test_time <= source.time + tolerance

    The test_time value for matching from a datum can come through
    one of two methods driven by the constructor argument "time_key".
    When time_key is a None (default) the algorithm assumes all input
    are mspass atomic data objects that have the start time defined by
    the attribute "t0" (mspass_object.t0).  If time_key is a string
    it is assumed to be a Metadata key used to fetch an epoch time
    to use for the test.   The most likely use of that feature would be
    for ensemble processing where test_time is set as a field in the
    ensemble Metadata.  Note that form of associating source data to
    ensembles that are common source gathers can be much faster than
    the atomic version because only one query is needed per ensemble.

class ArrivalDBMatcher(DatabaseMatcher):
    """
    This is a class for matching a table of arrival times to input
    waveform data objects.  Use this version if the table of arrivals
    is huge and database query delays will not create a bottleneck
    in your workflow.

    Phase arrival time matching is a common need when waveform segments
    are downloaded.  When data are assembled as miniseed files or
    url downloads of miniseed data, the format has no way to hold
    arrival time data.  This matcher can prove useful for matching
    waveform segments with an origin as miniseed.

    The algorithm it uses for matching is a logic and of two tests:
        1.  We first match all arrival times falling between the
            sample range of an input MsPASS data object, d.  That is,
            first component of the query is to find all arrival times,
            t_a, that obey the relation:  d.t0 <= t_a <= d.endtime().
        2.  Match only data for which the (fixed) name "sta"
            in arrival and the data match.   A secondary key match using
            the "net" attribute is used only if "net" is defined with
            the data.  That is done to streamline processing of css3.0
            data where "net"  is not defined.

    Note the concept of an arrival time is also mixed as in
    some contexts it means a time computed from an earth model and other
    time a measured time that is "picked" by a human or computer algorithm.
    This class does not distinguish model-based from measured times.  It
    simply uses the time and station tag information with the algorithm
    noted above to attempt a match.

class ArrivalMatcher(DataFrameCacheMatcher):
    """
    This is a class for matching a table of arrival times to input
    waveform data objects.  Use this version if the table of arrivals
    is not huge enough to cause a memory problem.

    Phase arrival time matching is a common need when waveform segments
    are downloaded.  When data are assembled as miniseed files or
    url downloads of miniseed data, the format has no way to hold
    arrival time data.  This matcher can prove useful for matching
    waveform segments with an origin as miniseed.

    The algorithm it uses for matching is a logic and of two tests:
        1.  We first match all arrival times falling between the
            sample range of an input MsPASS data object, d.  That is,
            first component of the query is to find all arrival times,
            t_a, that obey the relation:  d.t0 <= t_a <= d.endtime().
        2.  Match only data for which the (fixed) name "sta"
            in arrival and the data match.   A secondary key match using
            the "net" attribute is used only if "net" is defined with
            the data.  That is done to streamline processing of css3.0
            data where "net"  is not defined.

    Note the concept of an arrival time is also mixed as in
    some contexts it means a time computed from an earth model and other
    time a measured time that is "picked" by a human or computer algorithm.
    This class does not distinguish model-based from measured times.  It
    simply uses the time and station tag information with the algorithm
    noted above to attempt a match.

    This implementation caches the table of attributes desired to an
    internal pandas DataFrame.   It is thus most appropriate for
    arrival tables that are not huge.  Note it may be possible to
    do appropriate preprocessing to manage the arrival table size.
    e.g. the table can be grouped by station or in time blocks and
    then processed in a loop updating waveform database records
    in multiple passes.  The alternative for large arrival tables
    is to use the DB version of this matcher.

    :param db:  MongoDB database handle  (positional - no default)
    :type db: normally a MsPASS Database class but with this algorithm
      it can be the superclass from which Database is derived.

    :param type:  list of strings defining collection keyes

    :param aliases:  python dictionary defining alias names to apply
     when fetching from a data object's Metadata container.   The key sense
     of the mapping is important to keep straight.  The key of this
     dictionary should match one  of the attributes in attributes_to_load
     or load_if_defined.  The value the key defines should be the alias
     used to fetch the comparable attribute from the data.
    :type aliaes:  python dictionary

    :param prepend_collection_name:  when True attributes returned in
      Metadata containers by the find and find_one method will all have the
      collection name prepended with a (fixed) separator.  For example, if
      the collection name is "channel" the "lat" attribute in the channel
      document would be returned as "channel_lat".

    :param require_unique_match:  boolean handling of ambiguous matches.
      When True find_one will throw an error if an entry is tries to match
      is not unique.  When False find_one returns the first document

    In MsPASS the standard support for station information is stored in
    two collections called "channel" and "site".   When normalized
    with channel collection data a miniseed record can be associated with
    station metadata downloaded by FDSN web services and stored previously
    with MsPASS database methods.   The default behavior tries to associate
    each wf_miniseed document with an entry in "site".  In MsPASS site is a
    smaller collection intended for use only with data already assembled
    into three component bundles we call Seismogram objects.


    For both channel and site the association algorithm used assumes
    the SEED convention wherein the strings stored with the keys
    "net","sta","chan", and (optionally) "loc" define a unique channel
    of data registered globally through the FDSN.   The algorithm then
    need only query for a match of these keys and a time interval
    match with the start time of the waveform defined by each wf_miniseed
    document.   The only distinction in the algorithm between site and
    channel is that "chan" is not used in site since by definition site
    data refer to common attributes of one seismic observatory (commonly
    also called a "station").

    :param db: should be a MsPASS database handle containing at least
    wf_miniseed and the collections defined by the norm_collection list.
    :param blockssize:   To speed up updates this function uses the
    bulk writer/updater methods of MongoDB that can be orders of
    magnitude faster than one-at-a-time updates for setting
    channel_id and site_id.  A user should not normally need to alter this
    parameter.
    :param wfquery: is a query to apply to wf_miniseed.  The output of this
    query defines the list of documents that the algorithm will attempt
    to normalize as described above.  The default will process the entire
    wf_miniseed collection (query set to an emtpy dict).
    :param normalize_channel:  boolean for handling channel collection.
    When True (default) matches will be attempted with the channel collection
    and when matches are found the associated channel document id will be
    set in the associated wf_miniseed document as channel_id.
    :param normalize_site:  boolean for handling site collection.
    When True (default) matches will be attempted with the site collection
    and when matches are found the associated site document id will
    be set wf_miniseed document as site_id. Note at least one of
    the two booleans normalize_channel and normalize_site must be set True
    or the function will immediately abort.


    :return: list with three integers.  0 is the number of documents processed in
    wf_miniseed (output of query), 1 is the number with channel ids set,
    and 2 contains the number of site documents set.  1 or 2 should
    contain 0 if normalization for that collection was set false.
