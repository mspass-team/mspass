        This is a core reader for Seismogram objects with MongoDB.  The unique
        document in the wf collection is selected by ObjectID (oid arg).
        That oid is used to select a unique waveform document.
        Samples can be read from system files or from gridfs.

        A string attribute extracted from the database with the key 'storage_mode' is
        normally used to tell the mode to use to fetch the sample
        data.   If that attribute is not found the method defined in the smode
        argument will be attempted.   When smode is gridfs, the method will
        load the Metadata from the wf collection which must include the string attribute
        wf_id.   It access the sample data from the gridfs_wf
        collection after creating a buffer space for the sample data.
        when smod is file the sample data is read by a C++ function that
        uses a raw binary read.

        This method was designed to never abort.  If the read failed the
        boolean attribute of Seismogram called 'live' will be set false.
        Both fatal and nonfatal errors will be posted to the elog member of
        Seismogram.  Callers should test live and handle fatal and nonfatal
        errors as appropriate to the algorithm.

            Save mspass::Seismogram object in MongoDB.

            This is a core method to save Seismogram objects in MongoDB.   It uses a
            feature in the C library (MongoDBConverter) along with capabilities built
            into the data object to add two important features:  (1) we can do pure
            updates to database attributes for pure Metadata procedures as well as full
            writes of new data, and (2) Seismogram has an error log feature that is
            dumped to a separate document (elog) if it has any entries.   Any data
            with sever errors are silently dropped assuming the user will use the
            error log document to backtrack problems.

            This method will immediately attempt to
            open a connection to the wf and elog collections.  An assumption of
            that algorithm is that doing so is lightweight and the simplification of
            a single argument is preferable to requiring two args that have to be
            checked for consistency.  If you don't want to clobber an existing
            database just create an empty scratch database before calling this
            method for the first time.

            :param d: Seismogram object to be saved.  Not if d is marked dead (live false)
                the method attempts to write an entry in elog to save the error
                messages posted for that seismogram.
            :param mdef: is a MetadataDefinitions object for schema used by d
            :param smode: mnemonic for SamplelMODE.   Options are currently supported:
            (1) 'file' - use the dir and dfile attributes to write sample
                data as a raw dump with fwrite.  File is ALWAYS appended so user
                can either change dir and/or defile and write to a new file or
                append to the parent data.   The method will fail if dir or
                dfile are not defined in this mode.
            (2) 'gridfs' - (default) data are stored internally in MongoDB's gridfs system
            (3) 'unchanged' - do not save the data.  This mode is required when mmode
                is set to updatemd (used for pure Metadata manipulations for efficiency)
            :param mmode: mnemonic for MetadataMODE.   Supported options are:
            (1) 'save' - contents are saved dropping all marked readonly (default)
            (2) 'saveall' - all Metadata attributes are saved even if marked readonly
                (most useful for temporary data saved inside a job stream)
            (3) 'updatemd' - run an update to the document of Metadata that have
                changed.  Nothing else is altered in this case. If smode is not set
                unchanged the method will throw a RuntimeError exception in
                the mode.  Similarly, if the ObjectID was set invalid, which is
                used internally whenever sample data are altered, the method will
                abort with a RuntimeError exception.
            (4) 'updateall' - both Metadata and sample data will be updated.  Note
                this mode should not be used if smode is set to 'file' as it is
                nearly guaranteed to create inaccessible holes in files.  A
                warning message is posted in this situation, but the program
                will blunder on.

        Load a Seismogram object stored as a gridfs file.

        Constructs a Seismogram object from Metadata and sample data
        pulled from a MongoDB gridfs document.   The Metadata must contain
        a string representation of the ObjectId of the document with the
        key gridfs_wf_id.  That string is used to generate a unique ObjectId
        which is then used to find the unique document containing the sample
        data in the collection called gridfs_wf (optionally can be changed with
        argument fscol)

        This function was designed to never throw an exception but always
        return some form of Seismogram object. Caller should test the boolean
        'live" attribute of the return. If it is false, it means this function
        failed completely.  The error log may also contain various levels of
        warning errors posted to it's internal ErrorLogger (elog) object.

            would normally be constructed from a parent document in the wf

            as described above.   Several other key:value pairs are required or
            the function will abort with the result returned as invalid (live=false).
            These are:  npts, starttime, and delta.   time_reference is a special
            switch for handling UTC versus relative time.   Default is UTC

        The algorithm is simple and should only be used in a context where
        the wf collection matches the same assumptions made here.   That is:
        1.  Each wf document has receiver coordinates defined with the mspass
            names of: site_lon, site_lat, and site_elev.
        2.  The scaling defining if a station is 'close' to another is
            frozen at 0.0001 degrees.  That comes from the highest precision
            digit for coordinates stored in Antelope.   If that is not
            appropriate the default can easily be changed for
            a special applciation.

        of the matching doc in site to each wf entry is defined by the

              equal tests.   Probably overly paranoid since these 
              fields are normally rounded to a time at the beginning 
              of a utc day, but small cost to pay for stabilty because

        object.  Optional MongoDB expressions can be passed

        This function is mainly intended to load the entire source

        query.   Use of the MongoDB queries is only sensible if

        in pick.loads of the serialized quakexml data.

        Finally, do NOT call this function unless you are sure
        every document in the source collection was produced from
        a web services request through the obspy mechanism to
        construct a Catalog object from a series of quakexml
        files.   It will throw a KeyError for 'serialized_event'

        query on depth passed as a dict

        Note for all queries you should pass the expression to
        be passed to MongoDB and not the key For example, to get all
        events with depth>100 km a direct query with find
        would use a construct like this:
            query={'source_depth' : '{'$gt' : 100.0}'}
        as a convenience to the user the key for the query is
        inserted (so you don't have to remember it).  The
        above example would be created from a call like this
            cat=load_catalog(dbsource,depth='{'$gt' : 100.0}')
        A great deal of functionality is possible with MongoDB,
        particularly with $regex but simple range queries like
        the above are simpler.
