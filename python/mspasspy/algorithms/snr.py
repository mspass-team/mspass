    Compute time-domain based signal-to-noise ratio with a specified metric.

    Signal-to-noise ratio is a fundamental measurement in all forms of
    seismic data processing.   There is, however, not a single unified metric
    that ideal for all types of signals one may want to analyze.  One class
    of metrics used time-domain metrics to use some measure of amplitude in
    a signal and noise window cut from a single waveform segment.  A type
    example is snr of some particular "seismic phase" (P, S, PP, ScS, etc)
    relative to some measure of background noise.  e.g. for P phases it is
    nearly universal to try to estimate snr from some window defined by the
    arrival time of P and a noise window before the time P arrives (pre-event noise).

    This function provides a generic api to measure a large range of metrics
    using one of four choices for measuring the norm of the data in the
    signal and noise windows:
        1.  rms - L2 norm
        2.  mad - median absolute difference, which is essentially the median amplitude in this context
        3.  perc - percentage norm ala seismic unix.  perc is defined at as the
            amplitude level were perc percentage of the data have an amplitude
            smaller than this value.  It is computed by ranking (sorting) the
            data, computing the count of that perctage relative to the number of
            amplitude samples, and returning the amplitude of the nearest value
            to that position in the ranked data.
        4.  peak - is the peak value which in linear algebra is the L infinity norm

    Note the user can specify a different norm for the signal and noise windows.
    The perc metric requires specifying what percentage level to use.  It is
    important to recognize that ALL of these metrics are scaled to amplitude
    not power (amplitude squared).

    This function will throw a MsPASSError exception if the window parameters
    do not define a time period inside the range of the data_object. You will
    need a custom function if the model of windows insider a larger waveform
    segment does not match your data.

    There is one final detail about an snr calculation that we handle carefully.
    With simulation data it is very common to have error free simulations where
    the "noise" window one would use with real data is all zeros.  An snr calculated
    with this function in that situation would either return inf or NaN depending
    on some picky details.  Neither is good as either can cause downstream
    problems.  For that reason we trap any condition where the noise amplitude
    measure is computed as zero.  If the signal amplitude is also zero we return
    a -1.0.  Otherwise we return a large, constant, positive number.  Neither
    condition will cause an exception to be thrown as that condition is considered
    somewhat to be anticipated.

    :param data_object:  MsPASS atomic data object (TimeSeries or Seismogram)
      to use for computing the snr.  Note that for Seismogram objects the
      metrix always use L2 measures of amplitude of each sample (i.e. vector amplitudes)
      If snr for components of a Seismogram are desired use ExtractComponent and
      apply this function to each component separately.
    :param noise_window: TimeWindow objects defining the time range to extract
      from data_object to define the part of the signal considered noise.

    :param signal_window:  TimeWindow object defining the time range to
      extract from data_object to define the part of the signal defines as
      signal to use for the required amplitude measure.  Default of -130 to

      is assumes a time relative to a phase arrival time.  For absolute times
      each call to this function may need its own time window.

    Estimates one or more amplitude metrics of signal-to-noise from a TimeSeries object.
    An implicit assumption is that the analysis is centered on a timeable "phase"
    like P, PP, etc.

    This is a python function that can be used to compute one or several
    signal-to-noise ratio estimates based on an estimated bandwidth using
    the C++ function EstimateBandwidth.  The function has a fair number of
    options, but the core metrics computed are the bandwidth estimates
    computed by that function.  It uses a fairly simple search algorithm
    that functions well for most earthquake sources.  For the low end the
    algorithm searches from the first frequency indistinguishable from DC to
    find the lowest frequency for which the snr exceeds a threshold specified
    by the input parameter 'band_cutoff_snr'.   It does a similar search
    from the high end from a point 80% of Nyquist - a good choice for all
    modern digital data that use FIR antialias filters.   Both searches are
    not just defined with just the first frequency to satisfy the snr
    threshold criteria.  Only when a group of frequencies more than 2 times
    the time-bandwidth product exceed the threshold is the band edge
    defined.   The actual band edge is then defined as the first frequency
    exceeding the threshold.  That more elaborate algorithm was used to
    prevent pure lines in either the signal or noise spectrum from
    corrupting the estimates.

    A set of optional metrics can be computed.  All optional metrics use
    the bandwidth estimates in one way or another.   Optional metrics are
    defined by the following keywords passed through a list (actually
    any iterable container will work) of strings defining one or more
    of the keywords. The metrics and a brief description of each follow:

    *snr_stats* computes what are commonly plotted in box plots for the
    snr estimates within the estimated bandwidth:  minimum, maximum,
    0.25 (1/4) point, 0.75 (3/4) point, and the median.   These are set
    with following dict keys:   'snr_band_maximum','snr_band_minimum',
    'snr_band_1/4', 'srn_band_3/4', and 'snr_band_median' respectively.

    *filtered_envelope*, *filtered_L2*, *filtered_Linf*, *filtered_perc*, and *filtered_MAD*:
    All of these optional metrics first copy the data_object and then
    filter the copy with a Butterworth bandpass filter with the number of
    poles specified by the npoles argument and corners at the estimated
    band edge by the EstimateBandwidth function.   The metrics computed
    are time domain snr estimates computed with he filtered data.  They are
    actually computed from functions in this same module that can be
    used independently and have their own docstring description. The
    functions called have the following names in order of the keyword
    list above:  *snr_envelope*, *snr_filtered_rms*, *snr_Linv*, and *snr_filtered_mad*.
    When the computed they are set in the output dictionary with the
    following (again in order) keys:  'snr_envelope','snr_filtered_rms', 'srn_Linf',
    and 'snr_filtered_mad'.

    It is important to note that all the metrics this function returns
    are measures of amplitude NOT power.   You need to be particularly
    aware of this if you unpickle the spectra created if you set
    save_spectra true as those are power spectra.

    :param data_object:  TimeSeries object to be processed. For Seismogram
    objects the assumption is algorithm would be used for a single
    component (e.g longitudinal or vertical for a P phase)

    :param noise_window: defines the time window to use for computing the
    spectrum considered noise. The time span can be either relative or
    UTC (absolute) time but we do not check for consistency.  This low
    level function assumes they are consistent.  If not, the calculations
    are nearly guaranteed to fail.  Type must be mspasspy.ccore.TimeWindow.

    :param signal_window: defines the time window to use that defines what
    you consider "the signal".  The time span can be either relative or
    UTC (absolute) time but we do not check for consistency.  This low
    level function assumes they are consistent.  If not, the calculations
    are nearly guaranteed to fail.  Type must be mspasspy.ccore.TimeWindow.

    :param noise_spectrum_engine: is expected to either by a None type
    or an instance of a ccore object called an MTPowerSpectralEngine.
    When None an instance of MTPowerSpectralEngine is computed for
    each call to this function.   That is a convenience for small
    jobs or when called with data from mixed sample rates and/or variable
    length time windows.   It is very inefficient to use the default
    approach for processing large data sets and really for any use in a
    map operation with dask or spark.  Normal use should be for the user to
    predefine an MtPowerSpectralEngine from the expected window size
    for a given data sample rate and include it in the function call.

    :param signal_spectrum_engine:  is the comparable MTPowerSpectralEngine
    to use to compute the signal power spectrum.   Default is None with the
    same caveat as above for the noise_spectrum_engine.

    :param band_cutoff_snr:   defines the signal-to-noise ratio floor
    used in the search for band edges.  See description of the algorithm
    above and in the user's manual.  Default is 2.0

    :param signal_detection_minimum_bandwidth:  As noted above this
    algorithm first tries to estimate the bandwidth of data where the
    signal level exceeds the noise level defined by the parameter
    band_cutoff_snr.  It then computes the bandwidth of the data in
    dB computed as log10(f_high/f_low).  For almost any application
    if the working bandwidth falls below some threshold the data is
    junk to all intends and purpose.  A factor more relevant to this
    algorithm is that the "optional parameters"  will all be meaningless
    and a waste of computational effort if the bandwidth is too small.
    A particular extreme example is zero bandwidth that happens all the
    time if no frequency band exceeds the band_cutoff_snr for a range
    over that minimum defined by the time-bandwidth product.  The
    default is 6.0. (One octave which is roughly the width of the traditional
    short-period band) which allows optional metrics to be computed
    but may be too small for some applications.  If your application
    requires higher snr and wider bandwidth adjust this parameter
    and/or band_cutoff_snr.

    :param tbp:  time-bandwidth product to use for computing the set of
    Slepian functions used for the multitaper estimator.  This parameter is
    used only if the noise_spectrum_engine or signal_spectrum_engine
    arguments are set as None.  The default is 4.0

    :param ntapers:  is the number of Slepian functions (tapers) to compute
    for the multitaper estimators. Like tbp it is referenced only if
    noise_spectrum_engine or signal_spectrum_engine are set to None.
    Note the function will throw an exception if the ntaper parameter is
    not consistent with the time-bandwidth product.  That is, the
    maximum number of tapers is round(2*tbp-1).   Default is 6 which is
    consistent with default tbp=4.0 where the maximum recommended is 8

    :param high_frequency_search_start: Used to specify the upper frequency
      used to start the search for the upper end of the bandwidth by
      the function EstimateBandwidth.  Default is 2.0 which reasonable for
      teleseismic P wave data.  Should be change for usage other than
      analysis of teleseimic P phases or you the bandwidth may be
      grossly underestimated.
    :param fix_high_edge:   boolean controlling upper search behavior.
      When set True the search from the upper frequency limit is disabled
      and the upper band limit edge is set as the value passed as
      high_frequency_search_start.  False enables the search.
      True is most useful for teleseismic body waves as many stations have
      a series of closely enough spaced lines (presumably from electronic
      sources) that set the high edge incorrectly.   False would be
      more appropriate for most local and regional earthquake data.
      The default is True.

    :param npoles:   defines number of poles to us for the Butterworth
    bandpass applied for the "filtered" metrics (see above).  Default is 3.

    :param perc:   used only if 'filtered_perc' is in the optional metrics list.
    Specifies the perc parameter as used in seismic unix.  Uses the percentage
    point specified of the sorted abs of all amplitudes.  (Not perc=50.0 is
    identical to MAD)  Default is 95.0 which is 2 sigma for Gaussian noise.

    :param optional_metrics: is an iterable container containing one or more
    of the optional snr metrics discussed above.

    :param store_as_subdocument:  This parameter is included for
    flexibility but should not normally be changed by the user.  As noted
    earlier the outputs of this function are best abstracted as Metadata.
    When this parameter is False the Metadata members are all posted with
    directly to data_object's Metadata container.  If set True the
    internally generated python dict is copied and stored with a key
    defined through the subdocument_key argument.  See use below in
    function arrival_snr.

    :param subdocument_key:  key for storing results as a subdocument.
    This parameter is ignored unless store_as_subdocument is True.
    Default is "snr_data"

    :param save_spectra:   If set True (default is False) the function
    will pickle the computed noise and signal spectra and save the
    strings created along with a set of related metadata defining the
    time range to the output python dict (these will be saved in MongoDB
    when db is defined - see below).   This option should ONLY be used
    for spot checking, discovery of why an snr metric has unexpected
    results using graphics, or a research topic where the spectra would
    be of interest.  It is a very bad idea to turn this option on if
    you are processing a large quantity of data and saving the results
    to MongoDB as it will bloat the arrival collection.  Consider a
    different strategy if that essential for your work.

    :return:  python tuple with two components.  0 is a python dict with
    the computed metrics associated with keys defined above.  1 is a
    mspass.ccore.ErrorLogger object. Any errors in computng any of the
    metrics will be posted to this logger.  Users should then test this
    object using it's size() method and if it the log is not empty (size >0)
    the caller should handle that condition.   For normal use that means
    pushing any messages the log contains to the original data object's
    error log.  Component 0 will also be empty with no log entry if
    the estimated bandwidth falls below the threshold defined by the
    parameter signal_detection_minimum_bandwidth.

    """
    Specialization of FD_snr_estimator.   A common situation where snr
    data is a critical thing to estimate is data windowed around a given
    seismic phase.   FD_snr_estimator is a bit more generic.  This function
    removes some of the options from the more generic function and
    has a frozen structure appropriate for measuring snr of a particular phase.
    In particular it always stores the results as a subdocument (python dict)
    keyed by the name defined in the metadata_output_key argument.
    This function has a close sibling called "broadband_snr_QC" that
    has similar behavior but add some additional functionality.   The
    most significant limitation of this function relative to broadband_snr_QC
    is that this function ONLY accepts TimeSeries data as input.

    This function is most appropriate
    for QC done within a workflow where the model is to process a large
    data set and winnow it down to separate the wheat from the chaff, to
    use a cliche consistent with "winnow".   In that situation the normal
    use would be to run this function with a map operator on atomic data
    and follow it with a call to filter to remove dead data and/or filter
    with tests on the computed metrics.  See User's Manual for guidance on
    this topic.  Because that is the expected normal use of this function
    the kill_null_signals boolean defaults to True.

    To be more robust the function tries to handle a common error.  That is,
    if the input data has a UTC time standard then the noise and signal
    windows would need to be shifted to some reference time to make any sense.
    Consequently, this algorithm silently handles that situation automatically
    with a simple test.  If the data are relative time no test of the
    time window range is made.  If the data are UTC, however, it tests if
    the signal time window is inside the data range.  If not, it shifts the
    time windows by a time it tries to pull from the input with the key
    defined by "arrival_time_key".  If that attribute is not defined a
    message is posted to elog of the input datum and it is returned with
    no other change.   (i.e. the attribute normally output with the tag
    defined by metadata_output_key will not exist in the output).
    Large data workflows need to handle this condition,.

    Dead inputs are handled the standard way - returned immediately with no change.

    Most parameters for this function are described in detail in the
    docstring for FD_snr_estimator.  The user is referred there to
    see the usage.   The following are added for this specialization:

    :param phase_name:  Name tag for the seismic phase being analyzed.
    This string is saved to the output subdocument with the key "phase".
    The default is "P"

    :param arrival_time_key:  key (string) used to fetch an arrival time
      if the data are in UTC and the time window received does not overlap
      the data range (see above)

    :param kill_null_signals:  boolean controlling how null snr estimator
    returns are handled.  When True (default) if FD_snr_estimator returns a null
    result (no apparent signal) that input datum is killed before being
    returned.  In that situation no snr metrics will be in the output because
    null means FD_snr_estimator couldn't detect a signal and the algorithm
    failed.   When False the datum is returned silently but
    will have no snr data defined in a dict stored with the key
    metadata_output_key (i.e. that attribute will be undefined in output)

    :param metadata_output_key:  is a string used as a key under which the
    subdocument (python dict) created internally is stored.  Default is
    "Parrival".   The idea is if multiple phases are being analyzed
    each phase should have a different key set by this argument
    (e.g. if PP were also being analyzed in the same workflow you
     might use a key like "PParrival").

    :return:  a copy of data_object with the the results stored under
    the key defined by the metadata_output_key argument.

    Compute a series of metrics that can be used for quality control
    filtering of seismic phase data.

    This function is intended as a workhorse to be used for low-level,
    automated QC of broadband data when the the data set is defined
    by signals linked to a timeable seismic phase.   It can be
    thought of as a version of a related function called
    "arrival_snr" with some additional features.  See the docstring
    for that function for what those base features are.   Features this
    function adds not found in arrival_snr are:
        1.   This function allows Seismogram inputs.  Only TimeSeries
             data are handled by arrival_snr.
        2.   This function provides an option to compute arrival times
             from source coordinates, receiver coordinates, and a handle
             to an obspy tau-p calculator.

    Otherwise it behaves the same.  Note both functions may or may not
    choose to interact with the function save_snr_arrival.   If you want to
    save the computed metrics into a form more easily fetched
    your workflow should extract the contents of the python dictionary
    stored under the metadata_output_key tag and save the result to
    MongoDB with the save_snr_arrival function.  That option is most
    useful for test runs on a more limited data set to sort out
    values of the computed metrics that are appropriate for a secondary
    winnowing of the your data.   See User's Manual for more on
    this concept.

    The input of arg 0 (data_object) can be either a TimeSeries or
    a Seismogram object.  If a Seismogram object is passed the "component"
    argument is used to extract the specified single channel from the Seismogram
    object and that component is used for processing.  That is necessary
    because all the algorithms used are single channel algorithms.  To
    use this function on all components use a loop over components BUT
    make sure you use a unique value for the argument "metadata_output_key" for
    each component.  Note this will also produce multiple documents per
    input datum.

    The type of the data_object also has a more subtle implication the
    user must be aware of.  That is, in the MsPASS schema we store receiver coordinates
    in one of two different collections:  "channel" for TimeSeries data and
    "site" for Seismogram data.  When such data are loaded the generic keys
    like lat are always converted to names like channel_lat or site_lat
    for TimeSeries and Seismogram data respectively.   This function uses
    the data type to set that naming.  i.e. if the input is TimeSeries
    it tries to fetch the latitude data as channel_lat while if it the input
    is a Seismogram it tries to fetch site_lat.   That is true of all coordinate
    data loaded by normalization from a source and receiver collection.

    The following args are passed directly to the function FD_snr_estimator:
    noise_window, noise_spectrum_engine, signal_window, signal_spectrum_engine,
    band_cutoff_snr, signal_detection_minimum_bandwidth, tbp, ntapers,
    high_frequency_search_start, fix_high_edge, npoles, perc, optional_metrics,
    and save_spectrum.  Below we only describe arguments added by this
    function:

    use_measured_arrival_time=False,
    measured_arrival_time_key="Ptime",
    taup_model=None,
    component=2,
    source_collection="source",

    :param data_object:  An atomic MsPASS data object to which the
    algorithms requested should be applied.   Currently that means a
    TimeSeries or Seismogram object.   Any other input will result
    in a TypeError exception.  As noted above for Seismogram input the
    component argument defines which data component is to be used for the
    snr computations.

    :param component: integer (0, 1, or 2) defining which component of a
    Seismogram object to use to compute the requested snr metrics.   This
    parameter is ignored if the input is a TimeSeries.

    :param metadata_output_key:  string defining the key where the results
    are to be posted to the returned data_object.   The results are always
    posted to a python dictionary and then posted to the returned
    data_object with this key.   Default is "Parrival"

    :param use_measured_arrival_time:  boolean defining the method used to
    define the time reference for windowing used for snr calculations.
    When True the function will attempt to fetch a phase arrival time with
    the key defined by the "measured_arrival_time_key" argument.  In that
    mode if the fetch fails the data_object will be killed and an error
    posted to elog.   That somewhat brutal choice was intentional as the
    expectation is if you want to use measured arrival times you don't
    want data where there are no picks.   The default is True to make
    the defaults consistent.  The reason is that the tau-p calculator
    handle is passed to the function when using model-based travel times.
    There is no way to default that so it defaults to None.

    :param measured_arrival_time_key: is the key used to fetch a
    measured arrival time.   This parameter is ignored if use_measured_arrival_time
    is False.

    :param taup_model: when use_measured_arrival_time is False this argument
    is required.  It defaults as None because there is no way the author
    knows to initialize it to anything valid.  If set it MUST be an instance
    of the obspy class TauPyModel (https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.taup.tau.TauPyModel.html#obspy.taup.tau.TauPyModel)
    Mistakes in use of this argument can cause a MsPASSError exception to
    be thrown (not logged thrown as a fatal error) in one of two ways:
    (1)  If use_measured_arrival_time is False this argument must be defined,
    and (2) if it is defined it MUST be an instance of TauPyModel.

    :param source_collection:  normalization collection for source data.
    The default is the MsPASS name "source" which means the function will
    try to load the source hypocenter coordinates (when required) as
    source_lat, source_lon, source_depth, and source_time from the input
    data_object.  The id of that document is posted to the output dictionary
    stored under metadata_output_key.

    :param receiver_collection:  when set this name will override the
    automatic setting of the expected normalization collection naming
    for receiver functions (see above).  The default is None which causes
    the automatic switching to be involked.  If it is any other string
    the automatic naming will be overridden.

    :return:  the data_object modified by insertion of the snr QC data
    in the object's Metadata under the key defined by metadata_output_key.

    This function is a companion to broadband_snr_QC.   It handles the
    situation where the workflow aims to post calculated snr metrics to
    an output database (normally in the "arrival" collection but optionally
    to a parent waveform collection.  ).   The alternative models as
    noted in the User's Manual is to use the kill option to broadband_snr_QC
    followed by a call to the filter method of bag/rdd to remove the
    deadwood and reduce the size of data passed downstream in large
    parallel workflow.   That case is better handled by using
    broadband_snr_QC directly.

    How the data are saved is controlled by four parameters:   save_collection,
    use_update, update_id and subdocument_key.   They interact in a way
    that is best summarized as a set of cases that procuce behavior
    you may want:
        1.  If save_collection is not the parent waveform collection,
            behavior is driven by use_update combined with subdocument_key.
            When use_update is False (default) the contents of doc_to_save
            will be used to define a new document in save_collection
            with the MongoDB insert_one method.
        2.  When use_update is True the update_id will be assumed to be
            defined and point be the ObjectId of an existing document
            in save_collection.   Specifically that id will be used as
            the query clause for a call the insert_one method.   This
            combination is useful if a workflow is being driven by
            arrival data stored in save_collection created, for example,
            for a css3.0 a event->origin->assoc->arrival catalog of
            arrival picks.   A variant of this mode will occur if the
            argument subdocument_key is defined (default is None).  If
            you define subgdocument_key the contents of doc_to_save will
            be stored as a subdocument in save_collection accessible
            with the key defined by subdocument_key.
        3.  If save_collection is the same as the parent waveform collection
            (defined via the input parameter wf_collection) the
            value of use_update will be ignored and only an update will
            be attempted.  The reason is that if one tried to save the
            contents of doc_to_save to a waveform collection would corrupt
            the database by have a bunch of documents that that could not
            be used to construct a valid data object (the normal use for
            one of the wf collections).

    :param db:  MongoDB database handle to use for transactions that
    are the focus of this algorithm.

    :param doc_to_save:  python dictionary containing data to be saved.
    Where and now this is saved is controlled by save_collection,
    use_update, and subdocument_key as described above.

    :param wfid:   waveform document id of the parent datum.   It is
    assumed to be an ObjectId of linking the data in doc_to_save to
    the parent.   It is ALWAYS saved in the output with the key "wfid".

    :param wf_collection:  string defining the collection from which the
    datum from which the data stored in doc_to_save are associated.   wfid
    is assumed define a valid document in wf_collection.   Default is
    "wf_Seismogram".

    :param save_collection:  string defining the collection name to which
    doc_to_save should be pushed.   See above for how this name interacts
    with other parameters.

    :param subdocument_key:   Optional key for saving doc_to_save as a
    a subdocument in the save_collection.   Default is None which means
    the contents of doc_to_save will be saved (or update) as is.
    For saves to (default) arrival collection this parameter should
    normally be left None, but is allowed.   If save_collection is the
    parent waveform collection setting this to some sensible key is
    recommended to avoid possible name collisions with waveform
    Metadata key-value pairs.    Default is None which means no
    subdocuments are created.

    :param use_update:  boolean controlling whether or not to use
    updates or inserts for the contents of doc_to_save.  See above for
    a description of how this interacts with other arguments to this
    function.  Default is False.

    :param update_id:   ObjectId of target document when running in update
    mode.  When save_collection is the same as wf_collection this parameter
    is ignored and the required id passed as wfid will be used for the
    update key matching.   Also ignored with the default behavior if
    inserting doc_to_save as a new document.  Required only if running
    with a different collection and updating is desired.  The type example
    noted above would be updates to existing arrival informations
    created from a css3.0 database.

    :param validate_wfid:   When set True the id defined by the
    required argument wfid will be validated by querying wf_collection.
    In this mode if wfid is not found the function will silently return None.
    Callers using this mode should handle that condition.

    :return:  ObjectId of saved record.  None if something went wrong
    and nothing was saved.
