class MTPowerSpectrumEngine:
    """
    Wrapper class to use German Prieto's multitaper package as a plug
    in replacement for the MsPASS class of the same name.   The MsPASS
    version is in C++ and there are some collisions in concept.  It should
    be used only in a python script where it might be useful to use
    features of Prieto's library not available in the cruder implementation
    in MsPASS.   (e.g. adaptive weights in multitaper power spectrum estimation).

    The biggest collision in concept is that the MsPASS version with this class
    name was designed to be created and moved around to avoid the overhead of
    recreating the Slepian tapers on each use.  Prieto's class creates these
    in the constructor but caches a number of things when first created that
    allows secondary calls to run faster.  The implementation attempts
    to overcome this collision by caching an instance of Prieto's mstspec class
    on the first call to the apply method.   Secondary calls to apply test
    for consistency with the previous call and only recreate the mtspec
    instance if something that invalidates the previous call has changed.

    :param winsize:   Number of samples expected for data window.  Note this
    argument defines the size of the eigentapers so it defines the size of
    input time series the object expect to process.
    :param tbp:  multitaper time-bandwidth product
    :param number_tapers:  number of tapers to use for estimators (See Prieto's)
    documentation for details)
    :param nfft:  optional size of the fft work arrays to use.  nfft should be
    greater than or equal winsize.  When greater zero padding is used in the
    usual way.  Default is 0 which sets nfft to 2*winsize.  If nfft<winsize
    a diagnostic message will be printed and nfft will be set equal to winsize.
    :param iadapt:  integer argument passed to Prieto's MTspec that sets the
    eigentaper weighting scheme.  See Prieto's MTspect class documentation
    for options.  Default is 0 which enables the adaptive weighting scheme.
