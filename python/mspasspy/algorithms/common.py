    Top level function interface to data scaling methods.
    
    This function can be used to scale seismic data contained in any of
    the four seismic data objects defined in mspass:  TimeSeries, Seismogram,
    TimeSeriesEnsemble, and SeismogramEnsemble.   An extensive set of 
    amplitude estimation metrics are available by selecting one of the 
    allowed values for the method parameter.   Ensembles can be scaled 
    at the individual seismogram level or as a whole (scale_by_section=True).
    Object level history can be enabled by setting preserve_history true.  
    See parameter descriptions for additional features for history preservation.
    
    Note all methods preserve the original amplitude by updating the 
    Metadata parameter calib to include the scaling.  i.e. as always the 
    amplitude of the data in physical units can be restored by multiplying 
    the data samples by calib. 
    
    :param d:  is input data object.  If not one of the four mspass seismic
      data types noted above the function will throw a RuntimeError exception.
    :param method: string defining the gain method to use.  Currently supported 
      method values are:  peak, RMS (rms accepted), perc, and MAD 
      (also accepts mad or Mad).  Peak uses the largest amplitude for 
      scaling.  For 3C data that means vector amplitude while for scalar data 
      it is the largest absolute value. rms is the standard rms measure, 
      although for 3C data is is rms vector amplitudes so scaling is by the 
      number of vectors not the total number of samples (3 times number of 
      vectors).  perc uses a sorted percentage clip level metric as used in 
      seismic unix.  mad is a variant where the value returned is the 
      median absolute deviation (mad) that is actual the same as perc=1/2.
      Default is peak.
    :param level:   For all but perc this defines the scale to which the data
      are scaled.  For perc it is used to set the percent clip level.  
      A RuntimeError exception is thrown if method is perc and level is larger 
      that one. Default is 1.0
    :param window: is an optional mspass.TimeWindow applied to compute amplitude 
      for scaling.  When not a null (python None) a windowing algorithm will 
      be applied before computing the amplitude metric and the amplitude 
      computed in that window will be used for scaling.   Default is None 
      meaning this option is turned off and the entire waveform segment is 
      scanned for the amplitude estimation.
    :param scale_by_section:  is a boolean that controls the scaling 
      behavior on ensembles only (It is silently ignored for atomic 
      TimeSeries and Seismogram data).  When true a single gain factor is 
      applied to all members of an ensemble.  When false each member is 
      gained individually as if this function were applied in a loop to 
      each member.
    :use_mean:  boolean used only for ensembles and when scale_by_section is 
      True.   The algorithm used in that case has an option to use the mean 
      log amplitude for scaling the section instead of the default median
      amplitude.
    :param preserve_history:
    :param instance:  preserve_history and instance are intimately related 
      and control how object level history is handled.  Object level history 
      is disabled by default for efficiency.  If preserve_history is set True 
      and the string passed as instance is defined (not None which is the default)
      each Seismogram or TimeSeries object will attempt to save the history 
      through a new_map operation.   If the history chain is empty this will
      silently generate an error posted to error log on each object. 
    :param dryrun: is a boolean used for preprocessing to validate 
      arguments.  When true the algorithm is not run, but the function
      only checks the argument list for invalid combinations.  This is 
      useful for prerun checks of a large job to validate a workflow.  
      Errors generate exceptions but the function returns before 
      attemping any calculations.  Default is false
     
    :return: amplitude(s) in a python array.   Array has only one element 
      for all returns except ensembles when scale_by_section is False.
    :rtype: For atomic objects returns the computed amplitude for the 
      data received through d and sets that value as array element 0.  
      For ensembles returns a pybind11 wrapped 
      std::vector of amplitudes for the ensemble members when scale_by_section 
      is false (member by member scaling) but only a single number in element 0
      for section scaling.   An empty return is possible without an exception 
      being thrown if a single atomic data type is marked dead or if the 
      ensemble received has no data.
