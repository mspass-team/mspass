    Top level function interface to data scaling methods.

    This function can be used to scale seismic data contained in any of
    the four seismic data objects defined in mspass:  TimeSeries, Seismogram,
    TimeSeriesEnsemble, and SeismogramEnsemble.   An extensive set of
    amplitude estimation metrics are available by selecting one of the
    allowed values for the method parameter.   Ensembles can be scaled
    at the individual seismogram level or as a whole (scale_by_section=True).

    Note all methods preserve the original amplitude by updating the
    Metadata parameter calib to include the scaling.  i.e. as always the
    amplitude of the data in physical units can be restored by multiplying
    the data samples by calib.

    :param d:  is input data object.  If not one of the four mspass seismic
      data types noted above the function will throw a RuntimeError exception.
    :param compute_from_window: boolean used to compute amplitude and scale
      based on a windowed section of the input waveform.   By default (this
      boolan False) the amplitude for scaling is computed from the full
      waveform.  When True the window argument must contain a valid TimeWindow
      that spans a time range smaller than the data range.  In that situation
      if the window is inconsistent with the data range the return will be
      marked dead and messages will be found posted in elog.  For ensembles
      all or only  portion of the group will be killed if this happens.
      Note this parameter is also ignored when scale_by_section is true.
    :param window:  mspass TimeWindow object defining the time range
      over which the amplitude for scaling is to be computed.  (see the
      compute_from_window parameter description)
    :param method: string defining the gain method to use.  Currently supported
      method values are:  peak, RMS (rms accepted), perc, and MAD
      (also accepts mad or Mad).  Peak uses the largest amplitude for
      scaling.  For 3C data that means vector amplitude while for scalar data
      it is the largest absolute value. rms is the standard rms measure,
      although for 3C data is is rms vector amplitudes so scaling is by the
      number of vectors not the total number of samples (3 times number of
      vectors).  perc uses a sorted percentage clip level metric as used in
      seismic unix.  mad is a variant where the value returned is the
      median absolute deviation (mad) that is actual the same as perc=1/2.
      Default is peak.  WARNING:  if an invalid value for method is passed the
      data will be returned unaltered with a complaint message issue for
      very datum (indivually or in ensembles) run that way.
    :param level:   For all but perc this defines the scale to which the data
      are scaled.  For perc it is used to set the percent clip level.
      If the value passed is illegal (0 or negative for most methods while
      perc must also be positive but less or equal 1) a complain message will
      be posted to elog and the level adjusted to 1.0.
    :param scale_by_section:  is a boolean that controls the scaling
      behavior on ensembles only (It is silently ignored for atomic
      TimeSeries and Seismogram data).  When true a single gain factor is
      applied to all members of an ensemble.  When false each member is
      gained individually as if this function were applied in a loop to
      each member.
    :param use_mean:  boolean used only for ensembles and when scale_by_section is
      True.   The algorithm used in that case has an option to use the mean
      log amplitude for scaling the section instead of the default median
      amplitude.

    :return: Data scaled to specified level.  Note the scaling always preserves
      absolute amplitude by adjusting the value of the calib attribute of the
      return so calib*data is the same value before and after the scaling.
    :rtype: same as input

    Cut data defined by a TimeWindow object.

    Cutting a smaller waveform segment from a larger waveform segment
    is a very common seismic data processing task.   The function is
    a python wrapper to adapt C++ code that accomplishes that task
    to the MsPASS framework.

    Note this function uses one model for being bombproof with a map
    operation.  Any exception that makes the result invalid will cause
    an error message to be posted to the elog attribute of the input
    datum AND the data will be marked dead (killed).

      This parameter is convenient to avoid conversions to relative time.
      A typical example would be to set t0shift to an arrival time and let

      which cause the function to assume twin is to be used directly.

    Splices a vector of TimeSeries objects together and optionally carves
    out a specified time window.  It acts a bit like an obspy function
    with the same name, but has completely different options and works
    with native MsPASS TimeSeries objects.

    This function is a workhorse for handling continuous data that are
    universally stored today as a series of files.   The input to this
    function is an array of TimeSeries objects that are assummed to be
    created from a set of data stored in such files.   The data are assumed
    to be from a common stream of a single channel and sorted so the
    array index defines a time order.  The algorithm attempts to glue the
    segments together into a single time series that is returned.
    The algorithm by default assumes the input is "clean" which means
    the endtime of each input TimeSeries is 1 sample ahead of the start time
    of the next segment (i.e. (segment[i+1].t0()-segment[i].endtime()) == dt).
    The actual test is that the time difference is less than dt/2.

    This algorithm treats two conditions as a fatal error and will throw
    a MsPASSError when the condition occurs:
        1.   It checks that the input array of TimeSeries data are in
             time order.
        2.   It checks that the inputs all have the same sample rate.
        3.   If fix_overlaps is False if an overlap is found it
             is considered an exception.
    Either of these conditions will cause the function to throw an
    exception.  The assumption is that either is a user error created
    by failing to reading the directions that emphasize this requirement
    for the input.

    Other conditions can cause the output to be marked dead with an
    error message posted to the output's elog attribute.  These are:
        1.  This algorithm aims to produce an output with data stored in
            a continuous vector with a length defined by the total time
            span of the input.  Naive use can create enormously long
            vectors that would mostly be empty.   (e.g. two random
            day files with a 5 year difference in start time)  The
            algorithm refuses to try to merge data when the span exceeds
            an internal threshold of 10^8 samples.
        2.  If fix_overlaps is false any overlap of successive endtime to
            the next starttime of more than 0.5 samples will cause the
            output to be killed.   The assumption is such data have a
            serious timing problem retained even after any cleaning.

    The above illustrates that this function behaves differently and makes
    different assumption if the argument check_overlaps is True or False.
    False is faster because it bypasses the algorithm used to fix overlaps,
    but is safer if your data is not perfectly clean in the sense of
    lacking any timing issues or problem with duplicates.   If the
    fix_overlaps boolean is set True, the mspass overlap handler is
    involked that is a C++ function with the name "repair_overlaps".
    The function was designed only to handle the following common
    situations.  How they are handled is different for each situation.
        1.  Duplicate waveform segments spanning a common time interval
            can exist in raw data and accidentally by indexing two copies
            the same data.   If the samples in the overlapping section
            match the algorithm will attempt to remove the overlapping
            section.   The algorithm is known to work only for a pair of
            pure duplicates and a smaller segment with a start time after
            a more complete segment.   It may fail if there are more than
            three or more copies of the same waveform in the input or
            one of the waveforms spans a smaller time range than the other
            but has the same start time.   The first is a gross user error.
            The second should be rare an is conceivable only with raw
            data where a packet or two was randomly saved twice - something
            that shouldn't happen but could with flakey hardware.
        2.  If an overlap is detected AND the sample data in the overlap
            are different the algorithm assumes the data have a timing
            problem that created this situation.   Our experience is this
            situation only happens when an instrument has a timing problem.
            All continuous data generating digitizers we know of use a
            timing system slaved to an external reference (usually GPS time).
            If the external signal is lost the clock drifts.  When the
            signal is restored if the digitizer detects a large time
            jump it may reset (time jerk) to tag the next packet of data
            with the updated time based on the standard.  If that time
            jump is forward it will leave an apparent gap in the data, which
            we discuss below, but if the jump is backward it will leave an
            apparent overlap with inconsistent samples.   The
            repair_overlaps function assumes that is the cause of all overlaps
            it detects.

    The final common situation this function needs to handle is gaps.  A
    gap is defined in this algorithm as any section where the endtime of
    one segment is followed by a start time of the next segment that is
    more than 1 sample in duration.  Specifically when
       (segment[i+1].t0()-segment[i].endtime()) > 1.5*dt
    The result depends on values of the (optional) windowing arguments
    starttime and endtime and the boolean "zero_gaps" argument.
    If windowing is enabled (done by changing
    default None values of starttime and endtime) any gap will be harmless
    unless it is present inside the specified time time range.  In all
    cases what happens to the output depends upon the boolean zero_gaps.
    When zero_gaps is False any gaps detected within the output range of
    the result (windowed range if specified but the full time of the input otherwise)
    When set True gap sections will be zeroed in the output data vector.
    All outputs with gaps that have been zeroed will have the boolean
    Metadata attribute "has_gap" set True and undefined otherwise.
    When the has_data attribute is set true the tap windows will be
    stored as a list of "TimeWindow" objects with the Metadata key "gaps".

    :param tsvector:  array of TimeSeries data that are to be spliced
      together to create a single output.   The contents must all have
      the same sample rate and be sorted by starttime.
    :type tsvector:  expected to be a TimeSeriesVector, which is the name
      we give in the pybind11 code to a C++ std:vector<TimeSeries> container.
      Any iterable container of TimeSeries data will be accepted, however,
      with a loss of efficiency.  e.g. it could be a list of TimeSeries
      data but if so another copy of the created internally and passed
      to the ccore function that does the work.  We recommend custom
      applications use the TimeSeriesVector container directly but
      many may find it more convenient to bundle data into a TimeSeriesEnsemble
      and use the member attribute of the ensemble as the input.
      i.e. if ens is a TimeSeriesEnsemble use something like this:
           outdata = merge(ens.member)
    :param starttime: (optional) start time to apply for windowing the
      output.  Default is None which means the output will be created
      as the merge of all the inputs.  When set WindowData is applied
      with this start time.   Note if endtime is defined but starttime
      is None windowing is enabled with starttime = earliest segment start time.
    :type starttime:  double - assumed to be a UTC time expressed as a unix
      epoch time.
    :param endtime: (optional) end time to apply for windowing the
      output.  Default is None which means the output will be created
      as the merge of all the inputs.  When set WindowData is applied
      with this end time.   Note if starttime is defined but endtime
      is None windowing is enabled with endtime = latest end time of
      all segments.
    :type endtime:  double - assumed to be a UTC time expressed as a unix
      epoch time.
    :param fix_overlaps:  when set True (default is False) if an overlap
      is detected the algorithm will attempt to repair the overlap
      to yield a continuous time series vectgor if it determined to have
      matching data.  See description above for more details.
    :type fix_overlaps:  boolean
    :param zero_gaps:  When set False, which is the default, any gaps
      detected in the output window will cause the return to be marked
      dead.  When set True, gaps will be zeroed and with a record of
      gap positions posted to the Metadata of the output.  See above
      for details.
    :param zero_gaps:  boolean
    :param object_history: boolean to enable or disable saving object
      level history.  Default is False.  Note this functionality is
      implemented via the mspass_func_wrapper decorator.
    :param alg_name:   When history is enabled this is the algorithm name
      assigned to the stamp for applying this algorithm.
      Default ("WindowData") should normally be just used.
      Note this functionality is implemented via the mspass_func_wrapper decorator.
    :param ald_id:  algorithm id to assign to history record (used only if
      object_history is set True.)
      Note this functionality is implemented via the mspass_func_wrapper decorator.

      Note this functionality is implemented via the mspass_func_wrapper decorator.
    :param dryrun:
      Note this functionality is implemented via the mspass_func_wrapper decorator.

    :return: TimeSeries in the range defined by the time span of the input
      vector of segments or if starttime or endtime are specified a reduced
      time range.  The result may be marked dead for a variety of reasons
      with error messages explaining why in the return elog attribute.

    A top mute is a form of taper applied to the "front" of a signal.
    Front in standard jargon means that with the time axis running from
    left to right (normal unless your native language is Arabic) the time
    period on the left side of a plot.   Data tagged at times less than what we
    call the zero time here are always zeroed.  The mute defines a ramp function
    running from the zero time to the "one" time.  In the ramp zone the
    ramp function multiplies the sample data so it is a form of "taper" as
    used in Fourier analysis.  This class should normally only be used on data with the time
    reference type set Relative.  It can be applied to UTC time standard data but
    with such data one of these objects would often need to be created for
    each atomic data object, which would be horribly inefficient.  In most
