    Top level function interface to data scaling methods.

    This function can be used to scale seismic data contained in any of
    the four seismic data objects defined in mspass:  TimeSeries, Seismogram,
    TimeSeriesEnsemble, and SeismogramEnsemble.   An extensive set of
    amplitude estimation metrics are available by selecting one of the
    allowed values for the method parameter.   Ensembles can be scaled
    at the individual seismogram level or as a whole (scale_by_section=True).

    Note all methods preserve the original amplitude by updating the
    Metadata parameter calib to include the scaling.  i.e. as always the
    amplitude of the data in physical units can be restored by multiplying
    the data samples by calib.

    :param d:  is input data object.  If not one of the four mspass seismic
      data types noted above the function will throw a RuntimeError exception.
    :param compute_from_window: boolean used to compute amplitude and scale
      based on a windowed section of the input waveform.   By default (this
      boolan False) the amplitude for scaling is computed from the full
      waveform.  When True the window argument must contain a valid TimeWindow
      that spans a time range smaller than the data range.  In that situation
      if the window is inconsistent with the data range the return will be
      marked dead and messages will be found posted in elog.  For ensembles
      all or only  portion of the group will be killed if this happens.
      Note this parameter is also ignored when scale_by_section is true.
    :param window:  mspass TimeWindow object defining the time range
      over which the amplitude for scaling is to be computed.  (see the
      compute_from_window parameter description)
    :param method: string defining the gain method to use.  Currently supported
      method values are:  peak, RMS (rms accepted), perc, and MAD
      (also accepts mad or Mad).  Peak uses the largest amplitude for
      scaling.  For 3C data that means vector amplitude while for scalar data
      it is the largest absolute value. rms is the standard rms measure,
      although for 3C data is is rms vector amplitudes so scaling is by the
      number of vectors not the total number of samples (3 times number of
      vectors).  perc uses a sorted percentage clip level metric as used in
      seismic unix.  mad is a variant where the value returned is the
      median absolute deviation (mad) that is actual the same as perc=1/2.
      Default is peak.  WARNING:  if an invalid value for method is passed the
      data will be returned unaltered with a complaint message issue for
      very datum (indivually or in ensembles) run that way.
    :param level:   For all but perc this defines the scale to which the data
      are scaled.  For perc it is used to set the percent clip level.
      If the value passed is illegal (0 or negative for most methods while
      perc must also be positive but less or equal 1) a complain message will
      be posted to elog and the level adjusted to 1.0.
    :param scale_by_section:  is a boolean that controls the scaling
      behavior on ensembles only (It is silently ignored for atomic
      TimeSeries and Seismogram data).  When true a single gain factor is
      applied to all members of an ensemble.  When false each member is
      gained individually as if this function were applied in a loop to
      each member.
    :param use_mean:  boolean used only for ensembles and when scale_by_section is
      True.   The algorithm used in that case has an option to use the mean
      log amplitude for scaling the section instead of the default median
      amplitude.

    :return: Data scaled to specified level.  Note the scaling always preserves
      absolute amplitude by adjusting the value of the calib attribute of the
      return so calib*data is the same value before and after the scaling.
    :rtype: same as input

    left to right (normal unless your native language is Arabic) the time
    period on the left side of a plot.   Data tagged at times less than what we
    call the zero time here are always zeroed.  The mute defines a ramp function
    running from the zero time to the "one" time.  In the ramp zone the
    ramp function multiplies the sample data so it is a form of "taper" as
    used in Fourier analysis.  This class should normally only be used on data with the time
    reference type set Relative.  It can be applied to UTC time standard data but
