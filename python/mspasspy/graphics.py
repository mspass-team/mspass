    """
    Plot a numpy 2D array (matrix) in a wiggle trace, variable area
    format as used in paper seismic section displays.   This is the low
    level function that displays a ensemble of scalar data cast into
    a matrix with the rows as time and the columns as just trace number.
    This function is called by the ensemble plotters.  For scalar data
    it is called one but for 3C data 3 windows are created with this
    function called 3 times.

    This function was taken directly from the fatiando a terra
    0.5 package.   The current web site is https://www.fatiando.org/
    and apparently the code we use here has been depricated by that
    group.   This function is unaltered from the original found on
    github for the 0.5 version.  Only the documentation was changed
    to clarify this ancestory.  We also changed the name from
    seismic_wiggle to wtva_raw to mesh more cleanly with mspass as
    the name better reflects the functions use.

    Additional changes:

    August 27, 20240:  Pavlis Added a test that if color was a None only the wiggles will be drawn
    (i.e. no shading)

    Parameters:

    :param section :  2D array
        matrix of traces (first dimension time, second dimension traces)
    :param t0 : float
        time of first sample (added for mspass - needed for passive data)
    :param dt : float
        sample rate in seconds
    :param ranges : (x1, x2)
        min and max horizontal values (default trace number)
    :param scale : float
        scale factor multiplied by the section values before plotting
    :param color : tuple of strings
        Color for filling the wiggle, positive  and negative lobes.  If None
        draw only wiggle traces
    :param normalize :
        True to normalizes all trace in the section using global max/min
        data will be in the range (-0.5, 0.5) zero centered

    .. warning::

        Slow for more than 200 traces, in this case decimate your
        data or use ``image_raw``.

    Plot a numpy 2D array (matrix) in an image format.  This type of

    immediately following a call to wtva_raw to produce an section

class SectionPlotter:
    """
    This class was designed to plot data in a seismic reflection style
    display.  That means time is the y axis but runs in a reverse direction
    and traces are equally spaced along the x axis. The data can be plotted
    as simple wiggle traces, wiggle trace variable area, an image format,
    and a wiggletrace variable area plot overlaying an image plot.

    The object itself only defines the style of plot to be produced along
    with other assorted plot parameters.   The plot method can be called on
    any mspass data object to produce a graphic display.   TimeSeries
    data produce a frame with one seismogram plotted.  Seismogram data
    will produce a one frame display with the 3 components arranged in
    component order from left to right.  TimeSeriesEnsembles produce
    conventional reflection style sections with the data displayed from
    left to right in whatever order the ensemble is sorted to.
    SeismogramEnsembles are the only type that create multiple windows.
    That is, each component is displayed in a different window.   The
    display can be understood as a conversion of a SeismogramEnsemble to
    a set of 3 TimeSeriesEnsembles that are displayed in 3 windows.
    The component can be deduced only from the title string with
    has :0, :1, and :2 appended to it to denote components 0, 1, and 2
    respectively.

    The plots produced by this object are simple ones for display only.
    The concept is that fancier tools for gui interaction like a trace
    editor be created as children of this base class.

    """
    This is a special class to handle ensembles.   It forces a solution
    that can be mysterous for a naive use of the more general SeismicPlotter.
    That is, with a large ensemble the plot can easily come out a black
    image when the number of ensemble members are of the order of 1/10
    or more of the number of pixels defining the y axis.  The way thsi
    subclass addresses that is by forcing the following:
        1.  It normally produces multiple plots to display data in blocks.
            sac users can think of this like theh "perplot" argument used
            in the sac ppk function.
        2.  It defaults to wiggle trace only plots to improve performance.
        3.  It defaults to automatic scaling assuming that for many
            inputs something always needs to be scaled
        4.  It will only accept ensemble objects

    Note since this is a subclass of SeismicPlotter, Seismogram enembles
    will be plotted in three different figure windows.

    Be warned large ensembles can produce a very large number of plots
    with a single call to the plot method of this class.  With interactive
    use you may need to click on a lot of windows to see all the data and
    for notebooks you can quickly create a huge notebook.  All plotting
    for large data sets must be done with caution.
