    """
    Plot a numpy 2D array (matrix) in a wiggle trace, variable area
    format as used in paper seismic section displays.   This is the low
    level function that displays a ensemble of scalar data cast into
    a matrix with the rows as time and the columns as just trace number.
    This function is called by the ensemble plotters.  For scalar data
    it is called one but for 3C data 3 windows are created with this
    function called 3 times.

    This function was taken directly from the fatiando a terra
    0.5 package.   The current web site is https://www.fatiando.org/
    and apparently the code we use here has been depricated by that
    group.   This function is unaltered from the original found on
    github for the 0.5 version.  Only the documentation was changed
    to clarify this ancestory.  We also changed the name from
    seismic_wiggle to wtva_raw to mesh more cleanly with mspass as
    the name better reflects the functions use.

    Additional changes:
        Pavlis Aug 27, 2020
    Added a test that if color was a None only the wiggles will be drawn
    (i.e. no shading)

    Parameters:

    * section :  2D array
        matrix of traces (first dimension time, second dimension traces)
    * t0 : float
        time of first sample (added for mspass - needed for passive data)
    * dt : float
        sample rate in seconds
    * ranges : (x1, x2)
        min and max horizontal values (default trace number)
    * scale : float
        scale factor multiplied by the section values before plotting
    * color : tuple of strings
        Color for filling the wiggle, positive  and negative lobes.  If None
        draw only wiggle traces
    * normalize :
        True to normalizes all trace in the section using global max/min
        data will be in the range (-0.5, 0.5) zero centered

    .. warning::
        Slow for more than 200 traces, in this case decimate your
        data or use ``image_raw``.

class SectionPlotter:
    """
    This class was designed to plot data in a seismic reflection style
    display.  That means time is the y axis but runs in a reverse direction
    and traces are equally spaced along the x axis. The data can be plotted
    as simple wiggle traces, wiggle trace variable area, an image format,
    and a wiggletrace variable area plot overlaying an image plot.

    The object itself only defines the style of plot to be produced along
    with other assorted plot parameters.   The plot method can be called on
    any mspass data object to produce a graphic display.   TimeSeries
    data produce a frame with one seismogram plotted.  Seismogram data
    will produce a one frame display with the 3 components arranged in
    component order from left to right.  TimeSeriesEnsembles produce
    conventional reflection style sections with the data displayed from
    left to right in whatever order the ensemble is sorted to.
    SeismogramEnsembles are the only type that create multiple windows.
    That is, each component is displayed in a different window.   The
    display can be understood as a conversion of a SeismogramEnsemble to
    a set of 3 TimeSeriesEnsembles that are displayed in 3 windows.
    The component can be deduced only from the title string with
    has :0, :1, and :2 appended to it to denote components 0, 1, and 2
    respectively.

    The plots produced by this object are simple ones for display only.
    The concept is that fancier tools for gui interaction like a trace
    editor be created as children of this base class.

    SeismicPlotter is used to plot mspass data objects in the
    seismology convention with time as the x axis.  Use SectionPlotter
    to plot data in the seismic reflection convention with time on the
    y axis and oriented backward (increasing downward).

    Four times of plots are supported:  wiggle trace, wiggle trace variable
    area (i.e. filled on positive peaks), image plots, and colored wiggle
    trace variable area (wtva overlays an image display).
    Ensembles of Seismogram objects (SeismogramEnsemble object) are plotted in
    three windows that will appear as Figure 0, Figure 1, and Figure 2.
    All other object are displayed in a single window.   Default display
    order for ensembles is fill in ensemble order from the bottom up.
    Use the topdown() method to switch to reverse order.

    This is a simple plotter that just generates a basic graphic.
    The design idea is to use this as a base class for more advanced
    graphics uses like a trace editor or generic picker.  The
    plot object must be created before any plots can be generated.
    Any optional changes to the plot behavior, most commonly calls
