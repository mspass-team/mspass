    Indexer for SEED files that are already assembled in a
    "gather" meaning the data have some relation through one or more
    keys.   The association may be predefined by input though a
    keys array or left null for later association.   There is a large
    overhead in this function as it has to read the entire seed file
    to acquire the metadata it needs.  This version uses a bigger
    memory bloat than required because it uses obspy's seed reader
    that always eats up the whole file and returns a list of
    Trace object.  A less memory intensive approach would be to
    scan the seed blockettes to assemble the metadata, but
    that would be a future development.

    A KEY POINT about this function is that it ONLY builds an index
    for the data file it is given.  That index is loosely equivalent to
    the css3.0 wfdisc table, but organized completely differently.

    This function writes records into a import_miniseed_ensemble collection.
    The records written are a hierarchy expressed in json (bson) of
    how a Ensemble object is define: i.e. ensemble Metadata
    combined with a container of TimeSeries of Seismogram objects.
    Because SEED data always defines something that directly maps to
    TimeSeries this only works to create an index to build
    TimeSeriesEnsemble objects.

    This function was written to index ensembles that are passive
    array common event (source) gathers.  These are the passive array
    equivalent of a shot gather in reflection processing.   The
    format of the json(bson) document used for the index, however,
    is not limited to that case.  The gather type is defined by a
    metadata key (for this prototype the key is "gather_type").  The
    concept is the gather_type can be used as both a filter to select
    data and as a hint to readers on how to handle the data bundle.

    The gather (ensemble) metadata include a list of dict
    data that define a json/bson document defining the members of
    an ensemble.   Other documentation will be needed to define this
    concept more clearly with figures.

    A design constraint we impose for now is that one file generates
    one document in the import_miniseed_ensemble collection.   This means if
    the data for an ensemble is spread through several files the
    best approach is to convert all the data to TimeSeries objects and
    assemble them with a different algorithm

    A final point about this function is that it dogmatically always produces a
    unique uuid string using the ProcessingHistory newid method.   Be warned
    that that string CANNOT be converted to a MongoDB ObjectId as it is
    generated by a completely different algorithm.  The uuid is posted with
    the key "seed_file_id" to provide a unique name.  That id is used
    by the reader in this module to define a unique origin for a channel of
    data.  We note that usage is problematic for finding a particular
    waveform linked to a seed_file_id because the index storeds that
    attribute in subdocuments for each ensemble.

    :param db:  MongoDB database pointer - may also be a mspass Database
      class
    :param file:  seed file containing the data to be indexed.
    :param gather_type: character string defining a name that defines
      a particular ensemble type.  Default is "event", which is the
      only currently supported format.  (others keyword will cause an
      error to be thrown)  Anticipated alternatives are:  "common_receiver"
      or "station", "image_point", and "time_window".
     :return:  ObjectId of the document inserted that is the index for
      the file processed.

    Loads hypocenter data (space time coordinates) into an ensemble using
    an arrival time matching algorithm.  This is a generalization of earlier
    prototypes with the objective of a single interface to a common concept -
    that is, matching arrival documents to ensemble data using timing
    based on travel times.

    We frequently guide processing by the time of one or more seismic phases.
    Those times can be either measured times done by a human or an automated
    system or theoretical times from an earth model.   This function should
    work with either approach provided some earlier function created an
    arrival document that can be used for matching.  The matching algorithm uses
    three keys:  an exact match for net, an exact match for sta, and a time
    range travel time association.

    The algorithm is not a general associator.  It assumes we have access to
    an arrival collection that has been previously associated.  For those
    familiar with CSS3.0 the type example is the join of event->origin->assoc->arrival
    grouped by evid or orid.  We use a staged match to the ensemble to
    reduce compute time.  That is, we first run a db find on arrival to select
    only arrival documents within the time span of the ensemble with the
    defined arrival name key.  From each matching arrival we compute a theoretical
    origin time using obspy's taup calculator and a specified model and
    hypocenter coordinates in the arrival document that we assume was loaded
    previously from a css3.0 database (i.e. the event->origin->assoc->arrival
    view).   We then select and load source coordinates for the closest
    origin time match in the source collection.   This is much simpler than
    the general phase association (determine source coordinates from a random
    bad of arrival times) but still has one complication - if multiple
    events have arrivals within the time span of the ensemble the simple match
    described above is ambiguous.   We resolve that with a switch defined by
    the argument t0_definition.   Currently there are two options defining
    the only two options I know of for time selection of downloaded segments.
    (1) if set to 'origin_time' we assume member t0 values are near the origin
    time of the event.  (2) if set to 'phase_time' we assume the member t0
    values are relative to the phase used as a reference.  In both cases an
    optional t0_offset can be specified to offset each start time by a constant.
    The sign of the shift is to compare the data start time to the computed
    time MINUS the specified offset.  (e.g. if the reference is a P phase time
    and we expect the data to have been windowed with a start time 100 s before
    the theoretical P time, the offset would be 100.0)   Note if arrival windowing
    is selected the source information in arrival will not be referenced but
    that data is required if using origin time matching.  In any case when
    multiple sources are found to match the ensemble the one with the smallest
    rms misfit for the windowing is chosen.  A warning message is always
    posted in that situation.

    By default any ensemble members without a match in arrival will be
    killed. Note we use the kill method which only marks the data dead but
    does not clear the contents. Hence, on exit most ensembles will have
    at least some members marked dead.  The function returns the number of
    members set.  The caller should test and complain if there are no matches.
