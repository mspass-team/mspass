    antelope tables and updates a specified collection to add net code and,
    when necessary, repair station name used by antelope to deal with
    multiple sites have the same station code (sta) but different network
    codes.

    Antelope uses the css3.0 schema which was invented before anyone conceived
    the need for handling the quantity of data seen today assembled from
    multiple sources.  As a result the schema has a fundamental flaw
    wherein a channel is defined in css3.0 by two codes we refer to in
    mspass as "sta" and "chan" (these happen to be the same as those used by
    antelope).   When the SEED standard was defined the committee drafting the
    standard had the wisdom to realize sta and chan were not sufficient to
    describe data assembled from multiple sources when station codes were
    chosen independently by network operators.  Hence, they adopted the idea of
    adding a network (net) and location (loc) code to tag all data.   Hence
    all seed and miniseed (seed contains metadata as well as data.  A subset
    of seed called miniseed is the norm today which has only data bunched in
    packets with each packet keyed by net:sta:loc:chan:startime:endtime).

    All that background is included for users to understand the background to
    this function.  BRTT, the developers of Antelope, recognized the limitations
    of css3.0 early on but realized the depth of the problem long after their
    code base was deeply locked into css3.0.  Rather than fix the problem
    right they chose to use a kludge solution that has created a weakness in
    antelope ever since.  To handle duplicate stations they created a composite
    net:sta key with names like AAK_II and composite channel names (for loc
    codes) like BHZ_00.   Things might have been better had they made all
    sta keys this composite, but because users are locked into sta codes
    for a variety of reason they elected to retain sta and use the composite
    ONLY IF a duplicate sta was present.   That method works fine for
    largely static data in fixed network operations (their primary
    customers) but is a huge mess for research data sets bringing in data
    from multiple sources.  Hence, for mspass we need to get rid of anything
    remotely linked to snetsta and schanloc as cleanly as possible.  This
    function is aimed at fixing snetsta problems.

    The function works off an index passed as staindex created by a
    companions function called "parse_snetsta".   This function scans
    the collection it is pointed at (default is arrival, but any collection
    containing "sta" as an attribute can be handled) and looks for matching
    entries for the "fsta" field in snetsta.  When it finds a match it
    adds the net code it finds in the index, corrects the sta code
    (expanded in a moment), and sets a new attribute "css30_sta".
    The function handles composite names defined for sta by a simple algorithm
    that duplicates the way antelope handles duplicate station codes.
    If the station code is 3 characters or less the name is created in the
    form sta_net (e.g. sta='AAK' and net='II' will yield AAK_II).  If
    the sta code is 4 characters long the css30_sta is of the simple
    concatenation ofthe two strings (e.g. sta='HELL' and net='XX' yields
    'HELLXX').   If the code found is longer than 4 characters it is
    assumed to be already a composite created with the same rules.  In that
    case the name is split to pieces and compared to the index fsta and net
    values.  If they match the composite is used unaltered for the css30_sta name and
    the fsta and net values are added as sta and net in the update of the
    document to which they are linked.

    The function also tests documents it processes for an existing net code.
    If it finds one it tests for the existence of css30_sta.   If that
    attribute is already defined it skips updating that document.  If css30_sta
    is not defined it is the only field updated. This was done as a way to
    use a scan of the site collection as an alternative to setting net and
    then using this to set css30_sta as an alias for sta for some operations.

      of a client('dbname') definition or a mspass.Database class instance.

    the site collection.   (The default collection is arrival, but this could
    be used for any table for which sta needs to be regularized to a seed
    net:sta pair.)  The entire objective of the function is to add missing
    seed net codes.   The algorithm used here is the most basic possible and
    looks only for a match of sta and and option time matched with
    a site's operation interval defined by a starttime to endtime time interval.
    I returns two lists of problem children that have to be handled
    separately:  (1) a set container of station names that have no matching
    value in the current site collection, and (2) a set container with
    a tuple of [net, sta, startime, endtime] values of net:sta combinations
    that are ambiguous.  They are defined as ambiguous if a common sta
    code appears in two or more networks.   Both cases need to be handled
    by subsequent processing. The first, requires scrounging for the
    station metadata.  A good foundation for that is obspy's get_stations
    function.  The ambiguous station code problem requires rules and special
    handling.   That will be deal with in tools planned for the near future
    but which do not exist at the time this function was finalized.
    The key idea in both cases is to use the output of this function to
    guide additional processing with two different workflows aimed at
    building a clean database to initiate processing.

    :param db: is a MongoDB database handle.  It can be as basic as
      the return of client('dbname') but it can also be an instance
      of the mspass Database class.  There is no default.
    :param collection:  MongoDB collection to be updated.  Processing
      keys on the data with key="sta" and (optional) value of time_key arg.
      (Default is arrival)
    :param time_key: is a document key in collection containing a time
      used to match any site's operational starttime to endtime time window.
      Default is None which turns off that selection.  Ambiguous keys may
      be reduce in large datasets by using a time key.
    :param use_immortal_cursor:  If true the cursor in the update is made
      "immortal" meaning it won't time out.  This may be necessary if the
      arrival collection is large.
    :param stations_to_ignore: is expected to be a set container listing
      any station codes to be ignored in processing.   This can be used to
      reduce processing overhead or handle sites where net is null and
      not needed at all.   Default is None which turns this option off.
    :return:  Summary of results in the form of a 4 element tuple.
    :rtype:  tuple with the following contents:
        0 - number of documents processed
        1 - number of documents updated in this run
        2 - set container of tuples with content (net,sta,starttime,endtime)
            of all documents matching the reference sta code but having
            different net codes or time spans.   These data are stored in a
            set container to easily sort out the unique combinations.
        3 - set container of station codes that found in collection that
            had no matching entry in the site collection.
