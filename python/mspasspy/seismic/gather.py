class BasicGather(ABC):

    Base class for new MsPASS ensemble class that utilizes array
    implementations to store the data.  The implementtion may or may not
    provide for arrays that are too large to fit in memory.
    That behavior should be controlled by parameters on constructin.

    The data object defined by this class and it's children needs to be
    understood as appropriate only for ensemble data that satisfy several
    restrictions that the current MsPASS ensemble objects
    (TimeSeriesEnsemble and SeismogramEnsemble) do not rqequire:
        1.  All the data have the same sample rate.
        2.  Each signal has the same number of samples.
        3.  The data cannot have gaps.   Data with gaps neeed to be discarded
            or patched (e.g. with a gap fill) before being loaded into
            one of these contaienrs.

    Methods for this base class are largely getters and setters for
    univeral parameters that match the above.  It must be understood that
    with this design the base class is an incomplete skeleton that
    is fleshed out by subclasses.   This clsss has some virtual methods
    (defined with the ABC @abstractmethod decorator) and a set of methods
    that would never work if only the base class were contructed
    (not allowed because of the virtual meethods).  In particular, the
    way the base class handle metadata is potnetially confusing because
    the base class constructor only defines stubs for the data used to
    hold member and ensemble metadata

    A design issue for discussionis is whether not a gather should implement
    the ator and rota functionality of BasicTimeSeries.   The cost is
    tiny up front and retrofitting after that fact might cause a lot of
    headaches.

        This base class constructor should take the view that the base

        define scalar and 3C data as conrete implementations.

          expected to estimte the size of array needed and then call
          this constuctor before filling the array with data based on
          the input to the subclass constructor.  e.g. for MsPASS
          ensembles that would be set by len(ensemble.member).
