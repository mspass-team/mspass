  Function to convert python dict data returned by MongoDB find to mspass::Metadata.

  pymongo returns a python dict container from find queries to any collection.
  Simple type in returned documents can be converted to mspass::Metadata
  that are used as headers in the C++ components of mspass.  This is a core,
  bombproof routine to do that.  It handles supported types and will issue
  warning if asked to convert an unsupported type.

  :param d: is the dict created by MongoDB query
  :param mdef: is the MetadataDefinitions object used to validate types against
        keys and types expected by mspass.  If a mismatch occurs the
        function attempts to convert to the type defined in mdef.  If
        a key is missing the data are still converted and a warning is issued.
  :param elog: is expected to be an ErrorLogger object.   It should normally be
        already be a component of the Seismogram or TimeSeries with which it
        is or will be (read) associated.   Any conversions problems in
        this function will create log messages of different severity
        posted to elog.   If elog is not already linked to a Seismogram or
        TimeSeries an empty container must be created and passed AND after
        running if it is not empty it should be added to the data object
        being created.

    Convert obspy Stream to a Seismogram.

    Convert an obspy Stream object with 3 components to a mspass::Seismogram

    each component first to a TimeSeries and then calls a C++ function to
    assemble the complete Seismogram.   This has some inefficiencies, but
    the assumption is this function is called early on in a processing chain
    to build a raw data set.

    :param st: input obspy Stream object.  The object MUST have exactly 3 components

        less dogmatic about start times and number of samples as these are
        handled by the C++ function this python script calls.  Be warned,
        however, that the C++ function can throw a MsPASSrror exception that
        should be handled separately.

    :param mdother: This function always loads obspy required attributes and passes the directly to the mspass
        TimeSeries object..  For each entry in mdother the procedure tries to fetch that attribute.  It's type
        is then extracted from the MetadataDefinitions object and saved with the same key.

        can be a useful feature.  (default is an empty list)
    :param master: a Seismogram is an assembly of three channels composed created from
        three TimeSeries/Trace objects.   Each component may have different
        metadata (e.g. orientation data) and common metadata (e.g. station
        coordinates).   To assemble a Seismogram a decision has to be made on
        which component has the definitive common metadata.   We use a simple
        algorithm and clone the data from one component defined by this index.
        Must be 0,1, or 2 or the function wil throw a RuntimeError.  Default is 0.
    :param cardinal: boolean used to define one of two algorithms used to assemble the
        bundle.  When true the three input components are assumed to be in
        cardinal directions (x1=positive east, x2=positive north, and x3=positive up)
        AND in a fixed order of E,N,Z. Otherwise the Metadata fetched with
        the azimuth and dip keys are used for orientation.
    :param azimuth: defines the Metadata key used to fetch the azimuth angle
       used to define the orientation of each component Trace object.
       Default is 'azimuth' used by obspy.   Note azimuth=hang in css3.0.
       Cannot be aliased - must be present in obspy Stats unless cardinal is true

        of each data component.  Vertical angle (vang in css3.0) is exactly
        the same as theta in spherical coordinates.  Default is obspy 'dip'
        key. Cannot be aliased - must be defined in obspy Stats unless
