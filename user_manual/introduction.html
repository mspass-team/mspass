<h2>MsPASS Features<a class="headerlink" href="#mspass-features" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>MsPASS is an acronymn that stands for Massively Parallel Analysis System for Seismologists.
Some key features of MsPASS are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As the name suggests MsPASS is a domain-specific package for seismologists.
We emphasize, however, that our definition of seismologists is
broad.  It includes exploration geophysicists and anyone in any field that
needs to work with data that match the data models described in this
manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Few seismologists have strong expertise in modern information technology.
Furthermore, installing a software package can prove challenging today
even on a desktop on which you may have special privileges.  On large high performance (HPC)
systems installation is usually impossible to install special software
without a long string of
meetings and correspondence with system managers.  For this reason MsPASS uses
modern container technology to simplify installation.  That allows you
as the user to install MsPASS without system privileges.  Containers are
also essential for operating the package in a cloud system.</p></li>
<li><p>Another keyword in the acronym is “parallel”.  Computer technology reached
the physical limit of single CPU computers many years ago.  NO existing
open-source package for handling earthquake data provided consistent support for
parallel processing until MsPASS.</p></li>
<li><p>A first order goal of MsPASS was building
a consistent framework to allow scalability from a single desktop
machine with multiple cores to a giant cloud-based system. In MsPASS
we developed a simplified API for running processing in parallel.
The API makes it relatively easy to prototype a workflow with a test data set before
porting it to a large cluster to handle a more massive processing job.</p></li>
<li><p>MsPASS uses an integrated database management system that
was known previously to perform well in a massively parallel environment.
We use a stable, open-source system called MongoDB.  Our database API
aims to abstract interactions with MongoDB as much as possible, but
some knowledge of the query language used by MongoDB will be required to
use the package effectively.  There are several published books on MongoDB and
extensive documentation and tutorials are available online for the package.  Web
searches for MongoDB commands or a book at your side are an essential tool for
working with MsPASS at any level.</p></li>
<li><p>MsPASS uses python as the job control language.  This is in contrast to
traditional programs like SAC or older seismic processing systems that
use a custom command interpreter.   We assert that custom languages
like that in SAC or even the unix shell will become the equivalent of
Latin as a language in the coming years.  Python has emerged as the
most common glue language used within open-source software packages.  It was thus
the clear choice as the driver language for MsPASS.</p></li>
<li><p>Although python has huge advantages as “glue language” and as a way to
quickly develop prototypes, it also has a serious limitation.   Python,
like matlab’s command line language, is an interpreted language.  That means
it is essentially compiled on the fly.  Some classes of algorithms
will run orders of magnitude faster if implemented in a compiled language
like C/C++ or FORTRAN compared to python.  For this reason, we implemented
core data objects in C++.  Any python package with any hope of
performance follows this same model.  <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.obspy.org/">Obspy</a>
does this by manipulating
sample data with numpy and some core C libraries.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.brtt.com">Antelope</a> python
does this as well by implementing core functions in C. We follow this
model. Python functions and classes implemented in C/C++ are all
found in the MsPASS hierarchy as all modules under mspasspy.ccore.</p></li>
<li><p>Errors are a universal issue in large-scale data processing.   As the
size of a data set increases it is becomes an increasingly difficult to
guarantee all the data are “clean”.  By that, we mean one or more
algorithms may treat a particular data problem as an unrecoverable error.  Handling
errors in a large scale processing environment is problematic for a long
list of reasons.  We solve this problem in MsPASS by having error logs be an
intrinsic part of the data.   That approach is actually essential to
preserve errors using Spark and DASK.  It would be very difficult to
sort out problems from verbose log files that would otherwise be saved and
interleaved in a scratch, logs directory if we used simpler print statements.
Instead in MsPASS the error messages posted to any data object are automatically saved in the
database when the data object is saved with cross-references to the data with
which that error was associated.  In addition,
following a well-established approach
used is seismic reflection systems since the 1960s, MsPASS provides a
integrated “kill” mechanism that allows data to be carried along
but ignored.  That model maps well to massively parallel scheduling
because dead data are treated like live data but they just process faster.</p></li>
<li><p>To promote reproducible science MsPASS has an integrated processing history
capability.  The goal of that component of MsPASS is to ultimately allow
publication of the processing workflow used in a scientific paper that
would allow the reader to reproduce the data that paper used.  At the
time this user’s manuals was written that part of the system is incomplete.
For that reason (and for efficiency) MsPASS processing functions make
handling history optional and by default it is turned off.  If the system
grows as we hope that limitation will disappear.</p></li>
<li><p>The design of MsPASS has stressed leading edge but not bleeding edge open-source
technologies.  MsPASS was assembled from
a long list of general purpose, open-source packages.
Some are C/C++ libraries that
are linked with code in the ccore modules (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.boost.org/">boost</a>
and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a>)
and some are python packages like ObsPy.</p></li>

<h2>Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first step to use MsPASS is to install a local copy that you can use
for initial experimentation.
<a class="reference internal" href="../getting_started/run_mspass_with_docker.html#run-mspass-with-docker"><span class="std std-ref">Click here</span></a> for installation instructions.</p>
<p>We have an extensive set of tutorials based on jupyter notebooks
found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mspass-team/mspass_tutorial">here</a>.
For most people these are a good way to learn the package on their own.</p>

<h2>Organization of User Manual<a class="headerlink" href="#organization-of-user-manual" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The titles of the sections of this manual should serve as guides for
how to learn more about a topic of interest.   Except for this section the
manual is not intended to be read in the order of the topics posted as
hypertext in the contents page.  A learning model most people find most
effective is to work through the tutorials and reading sections of this
manual as questions arise or by following hypertext links from the tutorials.</p>
