/*! Base class for family of data objects created by Fourier transforms.

There are a range of algorithms used in seismology that center on the use
of Fourier Transforms.  This base class is intended to be used as
the base for any mspass C++ data object based on Fourier transforms
where the data are stored with a vector defined on a uniform grid in
frequency.  That means any algorithm based on fFTs.   The value of using
a base class is that power spectra and complex spectra have many
common concpets shared by this base class.  Classic use of inheritance to
avoid redundant code.
