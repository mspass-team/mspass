/* A Seismogram is viewed as a special collection of Time Series
type data that is essentially a special version of a vector time series.
It is "special" as the vector is 3D with real components.  One could produce a
similar inherited type for an n vector time series object.

The structure of a vector time series allows the data to be stored in a matrix.
Here we use a lightweight matrix object I call dmatrix.   This object is
contains core concepts that define a seismogram.   It can be extended as in
MsPASS to add functionality or aliased to Seismogram to simplify the naming as
done, for example, with std::basic_string made equivalent to std::string.

/*! \brief Vector (three-component) seismogram data object.

 A three-component seismogram is a common concept in seismology. The concept
 used here is that a three-component seismogram is a time series with a 3-vector
 as the data at each time step.  As a result the data are stored internally as
 a matrix with row defining the component number (C indexing 0,1,2) and
 the column defining the time variable.
 The object inherits common concepts of a time series through the
 BasicTimeSeries object.  Auxiliary parameters are defined for the object
 through inheritance of a Metadata object.

 Construct a three component seismogram from three TimeSeries objects.

 A three component seismogram is commonly assembled from individual
 single channel components.  This constructor does the process taking
 reasonable care to deal with (potentially) irregular start and end
 times of the individual components.  If the start and end times are
 all the same it uses a simple copy operation.  Otherwise it runs a
 more complicated  (read much slower) algorithm that handles the ragged
 start and stop times by adding a marked gap.

 If start or end times are not constant the algorithm shortens the output
 to the latest start time and earliest end time respectively.

 Note this constructor requires variables hang and vang, which are
 orientation angles defined in the CSS3.0 schema (NOT spherical
 coordinates by the way), by set for each component.  This is used to
 construct the transformation matrix for the object that allows,
 for example, removing raw data orientation errors using rotate_to_standard.
 The constructor will throw an exception if any component does not have
 these attributes set in their Metadata area.

\exception SeisppError exception can be throw for a variety of serious
    problems.

  this Seismogram.  Input vector order could be

/*! \brief Construct from Metadata definition that includes data path.
 *
 A Metadata object is sufficiently general that it can contain enough
 information to contruct an object from attributes contained in it.
 This constuctor uses that approach, with the actual loading of data
 being an option (on by default).   In mspass this is constructor is
 used to load data with Metadata constructed from MongoDB and then
 using the path created from two parameters (dir and dfile used as
 in css3.0 wfdisc) to read data.   The API is general but the
 implementation in mspass is very rigid.   It blindly assumes the
 data being read are binary doubles in the right byte order and
 ordered in the native order for dmatrix (Fortran order).  i.e.
 the constuctor does a raw fread of ns*3 doubles into the internal
 array used in the dmatrix implementation.

 A second element of the Metadata that is special for MsPASS is the
 handling of the transformation matrix by this constructor.   In MsPASS
 the transformation matrix is stored as a python object in MongoDB.
 This constructor aims to fetch that entity with the key 'tmatrix'.
 To be more robust and simpler to use with data not loaded from mongodb
 we default tmatrix to assume the data are in standard coordinates.  That is,
 if the key tmatrix is not defined in Metadata passed as arg0, the
 constructor assumes it should set the transformation matrix to an identity.
 Use set_transformation_matrix if that assumption is wrong for your data.

 \param md is the Metadata used for the construction.

 \param load_data if true (default) a file name is constructed from
 dir+"/"+dfile, the file is openned, fseek is called to foff,
 data are read with fread, and the file is closed.  If false a dmatrix
 for u is still created of size 3xns, but the matrix is only initialized
 to all zeros.

 \exception  Will throw a MsPASSError if required metadata are missing.

 Rotate data using a P wave type coordinate definition.

 In seismology the longitudinal motion direction of a P wave defines a direction
 in space.  This method rotates the data into a coordinate system defined by a
 direction passed through the argument.  The data are rotated such that x1 becomes
 the transverse component, x2 becomes radial, and x3 becomes longitudinal.  In the
 special case for a vector pointing in the x3 direction the data are not altered.
 The transformation matrix is effectively the matrix product of two coordinate rotations:
 (1) rotation around x3 by angle phi and (2) rotation around x1 by theta.

The sense of this transformation is confusing because of a difference in
convention between spherical coordinates and standard earth coordinates.
In particular, orientation on the earth uses a convention with x2 being
the x2 axis and bearings are relative to that with a standard azimuth
measured clockwise from north.  Spherical coordinate angle phi (used here)
is measured counterclockwise relative to the x1 axis, which is east in
standard earth coordinates. This transformation is computed using a phi
angle.   To use this then to compute a transformation to standard ray
coordinates with x2 pointing in the direction of wavefront advance,
phi should be set to pi/2-azimuth which gives the phi angle needed to rotate
x2 to radial.  This is extremely confusing because in spherical coordinates
it would be more intuitive to rotate x1 to radial, but this is NOT the
convention used here.  In general to use this feature the best way to avoid
this confusion is to use the PMHalfSpaceModel procedure to compute a
SphericalCoordinate object consistent with given propagation direction
defined by a slowness vector.  Alternatively, use the free_surface_transformation
method defined below.

A VERY IMPORTANT thing to recognize about this tranformation is it will
always yield a result relative to cardinal coordinates.  i.e. if the data
had been previously rotated or were not originally in ENZ form they
will be first transformed to ENZ before actually performing this
transformation.   Use the transform or horizontal rotation method to
create cummulative transformations.

 Rotate data using a P wave type coordinate definition.

 In seismology the longitudinal motion direction of a P wave defines a direction
 in space.  This method rotates the data into a coordinate system defined by a
 direction passed through the argument.  The data are rotated such that x1 becomes
 the transverse component, x2 becomes radial, and x3 becomes longitudinal.  In the
 special case for a vector pointing in the x3 direction the data are not altered.

 This method effectively turns nu into a SphericalCoordinate object and calles the
 related rotate method that has a SphericalCoordinate object as an argument.  The
 potential confusion of orientation is not as extreme here.  After the transformation
 x3prime will point in the direction of nu, x2 will be in the x3-x3prime plane (rotation by
 theta) and orthogonal to x3prime, and x1 will be horizontal and perpendicular to x2prime
 and x3prime.
