/*! \brief Slowness vector object.  

 Slowness vectors are a seismology concept used to describe wave propagation.
 A slowness vector points in the direction of propagation of a wave with a
 magnitude equal to the slowness (1/velocity) of propagation.

/*! \brief Fully parameterized constructor.

A slowness vector is defined by it's components.  There is one ambiguity, however,
with a zero slowness vector.  That is, normally direction of propagation is
inferred from the vector azimuth.  A zero slowness vector has physical significance
(normal incidence) but presents and ambiguity in this regard.  We use a defaulted
az0 parameter to specify the azimuth that should be used if the magnitude of
slowness vector is 0.

\param ux0 - set x (EW) component to this value.
\param uy0 - set y (NS) component to this value.
\param az0 - use this as azimuth (radians) if this is a zero slowness vector
	(default 0.0)
