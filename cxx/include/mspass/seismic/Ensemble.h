/*! \brief Template class that extends Ensemble to include an error log and live tests.

This class extends the Ensemble class defined in MsPASS for bundling
collections of data that can be pushed to an std::vector container.  The
class is actually very generic, but mspass defines it for TimeSeries and
Seismogram objects.   This class is a necessary extension for an algorithm
that take ensembles in and emits a different ensemble.  In that situation
we need a way to indicate the entire ensemble is invalid and not be to used
and post error messages that give an explanation of why the output is invalid.
This class provides that mechanism by adding a mspass::utility::ErrorLogger
and a (private) boolean defining if the ensemble has valid data.  That makes
the API to a LoggingEnsemble a hybrid with the atomic Seismogram and
TimeSeries objects (adds the dna of ErrorLogger and live/dead concept).

A secondary fundamental reason this class can be needed is to parallelize
algorithms that emit an ensemble (regardless of inputs).  The live/dead
tests and error logger make the handlers consistent with the atomic objects
of mspass.

Ensembles are the generalization in MsPaSS of a "gather" as used in
seismic reflection processing.  An Ensemble is just a vector of data objects.
This procedure assumes the member of the ensemble have ProcessingHistory
as a base class so they can access the history mechanism datta in MsPaSS.
The algorithm simply copies all history data from each live member to
the inputs vector of ProcessingHistoryRecord.

Do not use this procedure if the algorithm receiving the Ensemble can
ignore members of the Ensemble and mark them dead.  e.g. a robust
stacker might use a trimmed mean that discards some data without an
explicit kill.   Use the procedure that works on the atomic object, Tdata,
instead in such a situation.
