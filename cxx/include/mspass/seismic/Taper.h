A sine taper is a common, simple approach to taper data.  When applied at the
front it defnes a half cycle of a cosine curve +1.0 in range -pi to 0.  On
the right it defines the same function for the range 0 to pi.  The period
of the left and right operator can be different.  Turn off left or right by
giving illegal start and end points and the operator will silently be
only one sided. */
