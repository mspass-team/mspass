  the ProcessingHistory with the default constructor leaves the history
  in an empty state.   Users should call methods in ProcessingHistory to
  initiate a valid history chain.   Processing can continue if left in
  that state, but the history chain will have an undefined origin.  Job
  information will also be lost if not initialized (see BasicProcessingHistory)

  This constructor is a variant of a similar one built only from a

  simulation data created by some mechanism (e.g. a python procedure).
  It is more rigid that the simple one arg constructor as it will
  create a top level history record.   The record will mark the result
  as an origin with an id set as a uuid created by a random number
  generator (boost implementation).  The jobname and jobid are
  frozen as "test". Use a different constructor and/or reset job info
  if more flexibility is desired.  Use of this constructor
  is recommended only for test python programs that do not need to
  interact with MongoDB.

This constructor build a Seismogram object from all the pieces that define
this highest level object in mspass.   This constructor is planned to
be hidden from python programmers and not exposed with pybind11 wrappers
because is has some potentially undesirable side effects if not used
carefully.  The primary purpose of this constructor is for serialization
and deserializaton in spark with pickle.  The pickle interface is
purely in C for this function so again python programmers don't need
to see this constructor.  The parameter names are obvious because
they are associated one for one with the objects they are used to
construct.  The only exceptions are card and ortho which are booleans
used to set the internal booleans components_are_cardinal and
components_are_orthogonal respectively (two internals users should not
mess with).   tm is also a dmatrix representation the tmatrix stored
internally as a 2d C array, but we use the dmatrix to mesh
with serialization.

  /*! Constructor driven by a Metadata object.

  The flexibilityof Metadata makes it helpful at times to build a Seismogram
  object driven by Metadata key:value pairs.   This implementation always uses
  file io to read the actual data and clone the Metadata.   ProcessingHistory
  is initialized to define the result as raw data.  The id field is set from
  Metadata using the special (frozen) key "wf_id" that is assumed to hold the
  string representation of an ObjectID of the waveform read.

  Note all but the Metadata argument are defaulted, but setting the jobname
  and jobid is strongly recommended to avoid ambiguity - these define a unique
  run of a particular workflow.
