  Sometimes it is helpful to construct a skeleton that can be fleshed out

  initializes it to all zeros.   The data are marked dead
  because the assumption is the caller will fill out commonly needed basic
  Metadata, load some kind of sample data into the data vector, and then
  call the set_live method when that process is completed.   That kind of
  manipulation is most common in preparing simulation or test data where
  the common tags on real data do not exist and need to be defined manually
  for the simulatioon or test.   The history section is initialized with
  the default constructor, which currently means it is empty.   If a simulation
  or test requires a history origin the user must load it manaually.

  \param nsamples is the number of samples needed for storing the data vector.

      There are times one wants to use the Metadata area as a template to
      flesh out a CoreTimeSeries as what might be called skin and bones:  skin is
      Metadata and bones as BasicTimeSeries data.   This constructor initializes
      those two base classes but does not fully a valid data vector.  It only
      attempts to fetch the number of points expected for the data vector using
      the npts metadata (integer) key (i.e. it sets npts to md.get_int("npts")).
      It then creates the data vector of that length and initialzies it to all zeros.

      This constructor is largely a wrapper for the CoreTimeSeries version
      with the same signature but it also initalizes the ProcessingHistory
      to null (calling the default constructor)*/

  /*! Partially construct from Metadata alone.

  This constructor is useful for interaction with MongoDB where the
  Metadata container is constructed directly from MongoDB documents the
  database uses for storage.  A key restrition of this constructor is that
  BasicTimeSeries attributes and the size of the internal array buffer, which
  is set by npts, are extracted from Metadata with keys fixed in the C++ code.
  The following keys are required or this contructor will throw a MwPASSWrror:

    dt - sample sample_interval
    t0 - data startttime
    npts - number of samples (s array will be initialized to this many zeros)
    time_standard - UTC or Relative (anything but UTC is taken as relative)

  It will also handle but not require the two attributes used in the mspass
  schema to handle shifting from absolute to relative time.  These keys
  are
    t0_shift - sets amount t0 has been shiftee when originally utc but set
      to relative with the shift method.  Ignored if time is UTC or it is
      not defined.

  mspass specific features needed to mesh with the mspass processing system.
  This constructor clones only the CoreTimeSeries components and initializes
  the ProcessingHistory with the default constructor leaving the history
  in an empty state.   Users should call methods in ProcessingHistory to
  initiate a valid history chain.   Processing can continue if left in
  that state, but the history chain will have an undefined origin.  Job
  information will also be lost if not initialized (see BasicProcessingHistory)

  This constructor is a variant of a similar one built only from a
  CoreTimeSeries.  This constuctor is intended to be used mainly on
  simulation data created by some mechanism (e.g. a python procedure).
  It is more rigid that the simple one arg constructor as it will
  create a top level history record.   The record will mark the result
  as an origin with an id set as a uuid created by a random number
  generator (boost implementation).  The jobname and jobid are
  frozen as "test". Use a different constructor and/or reset job info
  if more flexibility is desired.  Use of this constructor
  is recommended only for test python programs that do not need to
  interact with MongoDB.
