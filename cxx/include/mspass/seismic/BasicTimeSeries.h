/*! \brief Type of time standard for time series data.

Time series data have two common standards.  Absolute time means the
time is an epoch time.  Relative means time is some other arbitrary
reference.  An example is an arrival time reference frame where all
data are set with time zero defined by a set of arrival time picks.

/*! \brief Base class for time series objects.

This is a mostly abstract class defining data and methods shared by all
data objects that are time series.  In MsPASS time series means
data sampled on a 1d, uniform grid defined by a sample rate, start time,
and number of samples.  Derived types can be scalar, vector, complex, or
any data that is uniformly sampled.

The seispp version of this class had public attributes for key data are
essential for defining any time series data (e.g. sample interval).
This was revised in MsPASS to use getters and putters to provide a cleaner
interface to python with pybind11.
