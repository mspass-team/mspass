/*! \brief C++ object version of a parameter file.

   This object encapsulates the Antelope concept of a parameter
file in a single wrapper.   The main constructor is actually
act much like the Antelope pfread procedure.
   Internally this object does not use an antelope Pf at all
directly, but it is a child of Metadata.  Simple attributes
(i.e. key-value pairs) are posted directly to the Metadata 
associative array (map) container.  Note that the
parser attempts to guess the type of each value given in the
obvious ways (periods imply real numbers, e or E imply real
numbers, etc.) but the algorithm used may not be foolproof. The get
methods are from the Metadata object.  Be warned like the Metadata 
object the type of an entry for a key can change and will be the last
one set.   
    An Antelope Tbl in a pf file is converted to an stl list
container of stl::string's that contain the input lines.  This is
a strong divergence from the tbl interface of Antelope, but one
I judged a reasonable modernization.   Similarly, Arr's are
converted to what I am here calling a "branch".   Branches
are map indexed containers with the key pointing to nested
versions of this sampe object type. This is in keeping with the way
Arr's are used in antelope, but with an object flavor instead of
the pointer style of pfget_arr.   Thus, get_branch returns a
AntelopePf object instead of a pointer that has to be memory
managed.
    A final note about this beast is that the entire thing was
created with a tacit assumption the object itself is not huge.
i.e. this implementation may not scale well if applied to very
large (millions) line pf files.  This is a job for something like 
MongoDB.   View this as a convenient format for building a Metadata
object.  Note, a code fragment to use this to create lower level
metadata would go like this:
  AntelopePf pfdata("example");   //parameter file constructor
  Metadata md(dynamic_cast<Metadata&>(pfdata);

This version for MsPASS is derived from a similar thing called a 
PfStyleMetadata object in antelope contrib.

    This constructor acts like the antelope pfread function for

    will follow the chain of directories defined by PFPATH.   As with
    the antelope pfread procedure the last file read takes precendence.
    Note if PFPATH is not defined the path defaults to ".".
    Further if pfbase begins with a slash (i.e. "/") it is assumed to be
    the actual file name to read and the PFPATH feature is disabled.
