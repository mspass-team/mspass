/*! \brief Lightweight data structure to completely describe an algorithm.

Processing data always involves application of one or more algorithms.
Most algorithms have one to many parameters that define the algorithm's
detailed behavior.  Because the size of parametric input can sometimes
be huge MsPASS needed a way to carry a concise summary of algorithms applied
to data.   The issue is complicated by the fact that the same algorithm
may be applied to data at diffrent stages with different parameters (e.g.
bandpass filters applied before and after deconvolution).  To address this
problem we save input parameters for any instance of an algorithm in MongoDB
as a document in the history collection.  This implementation uses a
simple string to define a particular instance.  In the current implementation
of MsPASS that is set as the string representation of the ObjectID defined
for that document.   An alternative would be UUID as used in TimeSeries and
Seismogram objects, but we prefer the ObjectID string here as it is a guaranteed
unique key by MongoDB, always has an index defined for the collection, and
reduces the size of the history collection by not requiring a uuid attribute.

Any algorithm for which no optional parameters are needed will have the id
field empty.

A special case is readers that act as origins from "raw"  which may not
literally be "raw" but is just a signal that a reader initiated a history
chain.   For readers input_type is set to "NotApplicable" and output_type
is to be defined for that reader.  Readers may or may not have control
parameters.
