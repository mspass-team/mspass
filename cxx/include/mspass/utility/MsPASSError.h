 This is the generic error object thrown by the MsPASS library.

 generic message and a virtual log_error method common to all
 MsPASS error objects that are it's descendents.

ErrorSeverity is bound with pybind11 and provides a way to define the

In fact, in the current implementation it calls parse_message_error_severity and converts
the result string to an ErrorSeverity it returns.    That process has a small
overhead and it is largely a decision of asthetics whether or not to use this
function of parse_message_error_severity.
