* lookup is also intended only for finding the external names associated with a

	A universal issue in a relational database interface is that an

		as it allows an output function to use an alias efficiently.

		the unique tag or an attribute.  An application must avoid
		modifying attributes that are part of the alias definition.
		The alias name is the only one that should normally be assumed
		current.
