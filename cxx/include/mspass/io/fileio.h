/*! \brief Fast file writer for native TimeSeries save to a file.

When saving data to a file system there is no standard way to do so we
know of that is faster than the low level C fwrite function.  This function
uses fwrite to write ONLY the sample data in the input TimeSeries object to
a file specified by a directory (dir) and leaf file name (dfile).  It can
do so because the std::vector container is required by the standard to define
a contiguous block of memory. This function is expected to be used in MsPASS
only under the hood of the python database writer for native saves.

The function constructs a unix path file name as dir+"/"+dfile.  If that
file does not exist it will be created.  If it does exist the write will
append to the existing file.   The attributes dir, dfile, and foff are
always saved in the data's Metadata container so they can be saved to
the MonogoDB database in MsPASS AFTER calling this writer.  For that reason
d is not const because it simply isn't.

\param d data to be saved (altered on return as noted above)
\param dir directory name (assumed to not contain a trailing /)
\param dfile leaf file name for save

\return file position in output file of the first byte written.
the same number is saved in the "foff" metadata attribute.

\expection This function will throw a MsPASS error for one of several
common io related issues. Caller should always include the call to this
function in a try block.
