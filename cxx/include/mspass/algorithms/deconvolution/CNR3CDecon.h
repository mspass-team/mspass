/*! \brief Colored Noise Regularized 3C Deconvolution opertor.

This algorithm is somewhat of a synthesis of the best features from the
various frequency comain methods currently in use for receiver function
estimation.  Key features are:
1. Data are tapered by a generic function with a range of options.
2.  The output is always a Seismogram, which in MsPASS means 3C data
3.  The inverse is regularized by a scaled 3C noise estimate.

This object is what might be called a processing object.  That is, it
does not use the model of construction creating the thing it defines
(Seismogram, for example, uses that paradigm).  Instead the constructor
defines the operator.  Data are processed by first calling one of the
loaddata and loadnoise methods.  Once valid data is loaded call the process
method to deconvolve the loaded data. Note this approach assumes the
data, wavelet, and noise used for the processing are internally consistent.
The user is warned there a no safeties to validate any consistency because
it would be hard to do so without causing more problems that it would
solve.  In MsPASS we expect to hide this a bit behind some python wrappers
to create some safeties.
