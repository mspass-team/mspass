/*! \brief Implements the Generalized Iterative Method of Wang and Pavlis.

This class is an extension of the idea o the generalized iterative method
described in the paper by Wang and Pavlis.   Their original paper worked
on scalar seismograms.  This implemenation differs by iterating on the
vector data effectively reducing a 3c seismogram to a sequence of
3D vectors at computed lags.   The iterative reduction then iterates
on the data matrix.   In addition, Wang's original implementation did the
iteration by repeated forward and inverse fourier transforms.  This algorithm
works completely in the time domain.

The class retains a concept Wang used in the original implementation.
Many OOP books stress the idea of construction is initialization.   That is
not pruddent fo this case since construction involves some work that we
do not want to repeat for each new seismogram.   Hence, construction only
initializes parameters required to run the algorithm. Calculation is
triggered by calling one of the two overloaded load methods.  The user
should be warned, however, that we did not build ina  test to assure
the noise and signal windows are consistent.  Anyone wanting to use this
code outside of applications developed by the authors must recognize That
the assure consistency they need to call loadnoise before load OR call
only the load method that includes a signal and noise window.
