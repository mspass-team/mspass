    /*! \brief Return a FIR respresentation of the inverse filter.

    An inverse filter has an impulse response.  For some wavelets this
    can be respresented by a FIR filter with finite numbers of coefficients.
    Since this is a Fourier method the best we can do is return the inverse
    fft of the regularized operator.   The output usually needs to be
    phase shifted to be most useful.   For typical seismic source wavelets
    that are approximately minimum phase the shift can be small, but for
    zero phase input it should be approximately half the window size.
    This method also has an optional argument for t0parent.   Because
    this processor was written to be agnostic about a time standard
    it implicitly assumes time 0 is sample 0 of the input waveforms.
    If the original data have a nonzero start time this should be
    passed as t0parent or the output will contain a time shift of t0parent.
    Note that tshift and t0parent do very different things.  tshift
    is used to apply circular phase shift to the output (e.g. a shift
    of 10 samples causes the last 10 samples in the wavelet to be wrapped
    to the first 10 samples).   t0parent only changes the time standard
    so the output has t0 -= parent.t0.

    The returned wavelet is always time shifted by nfft/2.

    \param t0parent - time zero of parent seismograms (see above).
