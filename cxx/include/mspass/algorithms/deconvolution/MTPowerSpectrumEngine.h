/*! \brief Multittaper power spectral estimator.

The multitaper method uses averages of spectra windowed by Slepian functions.
This class can be used to compute power spectra.  For efficiency the design
has constructors that build the Slepian functions and cache them in a
private area.  Use of the pply method that returns vector of
power spectral estimates.  Get methods can be called to get frequency
properties of the data returned.  This could have been done with a class, but
that was judged better left to a python wrapper using this class.

  This is one of two methods for applying the multiaper algorithm to data.

  elog complaint is posted to parent.   Short data are processed but should
  be considered suspect unless the sizes differ by only a tiny fraction
  (e.g. and off by one error from rounding).  Long data will be truncated

  size so if callers need that feature they must do that (simple) calculation
  themselves.   Unlike the TimeSeries method this one will throw an

  The computation of the Rayleigh bin size (dt) is actually quote trivial but
  this convenience functon allows users of the  vector<double> method to
  handle the comutation easily.  It uses the internal oeprator size, however,
  to compute the df size it returns because the operator is dogmatic about
  using that size.  Users wishing to call the frequency method and the apply
  method on raw vector data need to call this function before calling frequency.
