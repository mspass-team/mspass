/*! \brief Multittaper power spectral estimator.

The multitaper method uses averages of spectra windowed by Slepian functions.
This class can be used to compute power spectra.  For efficiency the design
has constructors that build the Slepian functions and cache them in a
private area.  We use this model because computing spectra on a large data
set in parallel will usually be done with a fixed time window.  The expected
use is that normally the engine is created once and passed as an argument to
functions using it in a map operator.

This class uses the apply model for processing.  It accepts raw vector or
TimeSeries data.  The former assumes the sample interval is 1 while the second
scales the spectrum to have units of 1/Hz.

  elog complaint is posted to parent.   Short data are processed but should
  be considered suspect unless the sizes differ by only a tiny fraction
  (e.g. and off by one error from rounding).  Long data will be truncated
  on the right (i.e. sample 0 will be the start of the window used).

  themselves.   Unlike the TimeSeries method this one will throw an

  The computation of the Rayleigh bin size is complicated a bit by the folding
  properties of fft algorithms that have to handle odd and even length
  inputs differently.   This algorithm uses the internally set nfft
  value to set the frequency bin size for even or odd nfft and the input sample
  interval.  NOTE POSSIBLE CONFUSION that input is time sample interval
  NOT the actual frquency bin size.  The reason is that the odd/even issue
  makes df dependent on if the fft size is even or odd.   We include this
  method as a convenience as that is an implementation detail for the fft
  algorithm.

  Note also this method sets not just df but the internally stored sample
  interval (symbol operator_dt in the source code.)
