/*! \brief Frequency domain shaping wavelet.

Frequency domain based deconvolution methods all use a shaping wavelet for
output to avoid ringing.  Frequency domain deconvolution methods in this Library
contain an instance of this object.  In all cases it is hidden behind the interface.
A complexity, however, is that all frequency domain methods will
call the Metadata driven constructor.

This version currently allows three shaping wavelets:  Gaussin, Ricker, and
Slepian0.  The first two are standard.  The last is novel and theoretically
can produce an actual output with the smalle posible sidebands*/

     with parameters defined by parameters passed through the Metadata object.

     \npts - length of signal to be generated which is the same as the fft
       size for real valued signals.   If set 0 (the default) the constructor

    /* \brief Use a wavelet defined by a TimeSeries object.
     *
     This constructor uses the data stored in a TimeSeries object to define
     the shaping wavelet.   Note to assure output is properly time aligned
     this signal is forced to be symmetric around relative time 0.   That is
     necessary because of the way this, like every fft we are aware of, handles
     phase.   Hence, the user should assure zero time is an appropriate
     zero reference (e.g. a zero phase filter should the dominant peak at 0
     time.)   If the input data size is smaller than the buffer size
     specified the buffer is zero padded.

     \param w - TimeSeries specifying wavelet.   Note dt will be extracted
       and stored in this object.
     \param nfft - buffer size = fft length for frequency domain representation
       of the wavelet.  If ns of d is less than nfft or the time range defined
       by d is does not exceed -(nfft/2)*dt to (nfft2)*dt the result will
       be sero padded before computing the fft. if nfft is 0 the d.ns will
       set the fft length.
