A sine taper is a common, simple approach to taper data.  When applied at the

the right it defines the same function for the range 0 to pi.  The period

/*! \brief Mute operator for "top" of signals defined first smaple forward.

A top mute is very commonly used in a many forms of seismic processing.
It is, for example, a very low level operation in traditional seismic
reflection processing.  A top mute zeros the front (forward in time from first
sample) of the signal and ramps up to a multiplier of 1 (does nothing)
at some later time.  It can also be thought of as a taper with only the
low side altered.  The implementation, in fact, uses the family of
mspass taper operators internally the the high time range (tail) turned off.

The main constructor uses a string keyword to select the type of tapering
applied to define the mute.   Because of the relationship to mspass tapers
there is also a constructor using the base class for Taper objects.  It
allows custom implementations of taper beyond those associated with
keywords in the definition passed to the main constructor.

  be used for this constructor because it requires more than 2 arguments
  to be defined.

  \param t0 is the end of the zeroed time range.  Date from the first sample
     to this value will be zeroed.
  \param t1 end ramp. Data with t>t1 will be unaltered.
  \param type defines the type of taper desired. Current options are
