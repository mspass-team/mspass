/*! \brief Estimate signal bandwidth.

Signal bandwidth is a nontrivial thing to estimate as a general problem.
The algorithm here is known to be fairly functional for most seismic data
that has a typical modern broaband response.  It makes an implicit assumption
that the noise floor rises relative to the data at low frequencies making
the problem of finding the lower band edge one of just simply looking for
a frequency where the spectrum of the signal is "significantly" larger than
the noise.  At the high frequency end it depends on a similar assumption that
comes from a different property of earthquake data.  That is, we know know
that all seismic signals have some upper frequency limit created by a range of
physical processes.  That means that at high enough frequency the signal to
noise ratio will always fall to a small value or hit the high corner of the
system antialias filter.  The basic algorithm used here then is an
enhanced search algorithm that hunts for the band edge and a high and low
frequency end where the snr passes through a specified cutoff threshold.
The algorithm has some enhancements appropriate only for multitaper spectra.
The algorithm searches from f*tbw forward to find frequency where snr exceeds
snr_threshold.   It then does the reverse from a user specified upper frequency.
To avoid issues with lines in noise spectra snr must exceed the threshold
by more than 2*tbw frequency bins for an edge to be defined.  The edge back is
defined as 2*tbw*df from the first point satisfying that constraint.

Note this function handles the calculation correctly if the signal and
noise windows have a drastically different length.  A subtle feature of
psd estimates of stationary processes is that the psd level scales by
1/length of the analysis window.   snr estimates correct for this effect.

\param df is the expected signal frequency bin size.   An error will be
thrown if that does not match the power spectrem s df.
\param s is a (multitaper) power spectrum of the signal time window
\param n is the comparable (multitaper) power spectrum of the noise time window.
\param snr_threshold is the snr threshold used to define the band edges.
\param tbp is the time-bandwidth product of the multitaper estimator used to
  estimate s and n (they should be the same or you are asking trouble but that
  is not checked).  tbp determines the expected smoothness of the spectrum and is
  used in the band edge estimation as described above.
\param fhs is an abbreviation for "frequence high start".   Use this argument
  to set frequency where backward (working downward in f that is) search for
  the upper band edge should start.   This parameter is highly recommended for
  teleseismic body wave data phases where the high frequencies just don't exist.
  P phases, for example, should set this parameter somewhere between 2 and 5 Hz.
  direct S phases should be more like 1 Hz, but that depends up on the data.
  The reason this is necessary is sometimes data have high frequency lines in
  the spectrum that can fool this simple algorithm.   In a C++ program there is
  a default for this parameter of -1.0.  When this argument is negative OR
  if the frequency is over the Nyquist of the data it will be silently set to
  80% of the nyquist of s.
\param fix_high_edge_to_fhs is a boolean that does what the verbose name
  says.  That is, when set true the search for the upper bandwidth edge is
  disable and the upper bandwidth frequency edge is set to fhs.   That
  option can be useful for teleseismic data as high frequency colored noise
  bursts at low thresholds can lead to poor estimates of the upper band edge.

\return BandwidthData class describing the bandwidth determined by the algorithm.

/*! \brief Create summary statistics of snr data based on signal and noise spectra.

This function is a close companion to EstimateBandwidth.   EstimateBandwidth
aims only to find the upper and lower range of a frequency range it judges to
be signal.  This function takes the output of EstimateBandwidth and uses it
to compute a vector of snr values across the bandwidth defined by the
output of EstimateBandwidth.  It returns the results in a Metadata container
with the following keys and the concepts they defines:
  "median_snr" - median value of snr in the band
  "maximum_snr" - largest snr in the band
  "minimum_snr" - smallest snr in the band
  "q1_4_snr" - lower quartile (25% point of the distribution) of snr values
  "q3_4_snr" - upper quartile (75% point of the distribution) of snr values
  "mean_snr" - arithmetic mean ofsnr values
  "stats_are_valid" - booelan caller should used as the name suggests.  That is,
     caller should first fetch this attribute and handle the resulting null
     condition.  When this is false it means the data have not detectable
     signal based on the computed spectra.

This function handles the calculation correctly if the signal and
noise windows have a drastically different length.  A subtle feature of
psd estimates of stationary processes is that the psd level scales by
1/length of the analysis window.   snr estimates correct for this effect. 

Note the function does attempt to avoid Inf and NaN values that are possible
if the noise value at some frequency is zero (negative is treated like 0).
If the signal amplitude is nonzero and the noise amplitude is 0 snr is
set to large value (actually 999999.9).  If the signal amplitude is also
zero the snr value is set to -1.0.  If you find minimum_snr is -1.0 it means
at least one frequency bin had the equivalent of a NaN condition.

\param n - noise power spectrum (must be the same data used for EstimateBandwidth)
