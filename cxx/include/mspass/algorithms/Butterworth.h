/*! \brief MsPASS implementation of Butterworth filter as processing object.

MsPASS has an existing filter routine that can implement buterworth filters
via obspy.   This class was created to allow a clean interface to Butterworth
filtering from C++ code that needs such an operator.   The original use was
an experimental deconvolution code, but there will likely be others because
simple, efficient filters are a common internal need for potential applications.

This C++ class can be viewed as a wrapper for Seismic Unix functions that
implement Butterworth filters.  The parent functions were found in the cwp
lib and were called bfdesign, bfhighpass, and bflowpass.  Those three functions
are the central tools used to implement this class.  All the rest is really
just a wrapper to provide an object oriented api to the su functions.

This  class implements a processing object concept.  That is, it is intended
to be constructed and then used for processing multiple data objects with fixed
parameters.   For Butterwoth filtering the parameters are relatively simple
(mainly two corner frequencies and number of poles defining the filter rolloff).
A complexity, however, is that the class was designed to allow automatic
handling of multiple sample rate data.   That is handled internally by
caching the sample interval of the data and automatically adjusting the
coefficients when the sample interval changes.   Note that feature only works
for MsPASS data objects CoreTimeSeries and Seismogram where the sample interval
is embedded in the object. The raw interface with a simple vector cannot know
that.  The method to change the expected sample interval has some sanity
checks to reduce, but not eliminate the possibility of mistakes that will create
unstable filters.

  /*! \brief Default constructor.

  The default constructor does not define a null.  The default generates an
  antialiasing filter identical to the default in the antialias function
  in seismic unix.   That is it produces a low pass filter with
  a band edge (pass parameter) at 60% of Nyquist and a stop edge at
  Nyquist.   It then calls the su bfdesign function to compute
  the number of poles and the 3db frequency of the corner to define this
  filter.   These can be retrieved with getters (see below)
  */
  Butterworth();
  /*! \brief Fully parameterized constructor with args similar to subfilt.

  A butterworth filter can be described two ways: (1) corner frequency and
  number of poles and (2) by band stop and band frequencies.  This
  constructor is used to define the filter by stop and pass band parameters.
  Frequencies must satisfy fstoplo<fpasslo and fpasshi<fstophi as the four
  frequencis define a bandd pass between the fpasslo and fpasshi.  The stop
  frequencies define where the response should near zero.   Thus for
  band pass filters the apasslo and apasshi should be 1 and the stop Amplitudes
  a small number like 0.01.  For a band reject filter set stop amplitudes to 1
  and pass amplitudes to small numbers like 0.01.
  (For a reject filter the pass frequencies act like stop frequencies for a
  bandbpass filer - this is mostly like the subfilt seismic unix program).
  The booleans control which terms are enabld.  When enable_lo is true the
  lo components are used an when enable_hi is true the high componens are used.

  There is a confusing nomenclature related to "high" and "low".   In this
  implmentation I always take low to mean the low side of the passband
  and high to be the high side of the passband as described above for the
  4 frequency point defiitions.   The issue is "lowcut" versus "lowpass".
  Seismic Unix really mixes this up as their implmenetation (which I used here)
  refernces bflowpass and bfhighpass but subfilt uses the inverse lowcut and
  higcut terminology.  A geeky implementation detail is I actually
  changed the names of the functions to eliminate the confusion in the
  implementation. That matters only if you want to compare what we did here
  to the original seismic unix code.

  Note the iir filter coefficiets are always derived from the poles and
  Frequencies so this constructor is just an alternate way to define the filter
  without the abstraction of number of poles.

  \param zerophase when true use a zerophase filter.
     When false defines a one pass minimum phase filter.
  \param enable_lo is a boolean that when true enables the low band parameters
     for the filter (i.e. the highpass=low-cut components)
  \param enable_hi is a boolean taht when true enables the parameters defining
    the upper frequency band edge  (i.e. lowpass=high-cut parameters)
  \param fstoplo - stop band frequency for lower band edge
  \param astoplo - amplitude at stop frequency
    (small number for band pass, 1 for band reject)
  \param fpasslo - pass band frequency for lower band edge
  \param apasslo - amplitude at fpasslo frequency
