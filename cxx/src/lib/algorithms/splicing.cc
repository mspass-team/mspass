/*! File scope class to enscapsulate set of possible data problems.

Merging multiple data segments to a single time series, which is
a common need with continous data, is prone to a number of practical problems.
Clock issues and the design of modern digitizers can cause a mismatch in
time computed by dt*nsamp and data time tags with formats like miniseed.
This can create apparent gaps or overlaps.   This class is intended to be
used to scan a vector of time-sorted segment to flag issues that need to
be handled downstream in algorithms later in this file. Issues it addresses
at present are:
1.  irregular dt
2.  segments marked dead
3.  overlaps
4.  gaps
5.  Computes the length of the data are merged.  Callers should test that
   that number is not absurd and could cause a memory alloc fault.

All attributes of this class are intentionally public as it should be
though of as a struct with convenient constructors.

This function will abort with an exception thrown in either of two situations:
1.  segments are not ordered by t0

Both are considered fatal errors as they would indicate a mistake in
usage that cannot be recovered.

/*! Function to handle overlapping data segments.

Overlapping data is a common raw data issue.  Data retrieved from data
centers has normally been purged from archives, but overlaps can still
occur.  The most common example is two miniseed files may contain the
same data and the user did not realize that data was present in the files.

The approach of this algorithm is to try to repair overlaps that have
matching sample data.   It looks for matches in a way that should work
even if the data have been scaled AS LONG AS the scaling is the same
for the two overlappign sections.   Whenever an overlap is found the
first segment of the pair is truncated and the second is retained.
If the overlapping segment data do not compare sample for sample the
first segmet of the pair (in time order) is killed, and error message is
posted, and the killed datum is pushed to the output.   The first is
always killed because with current generation data that situation always
means there has been a time jump backward to create the apparent overlap.
It is assumed that the segment killed had a timing problem.
