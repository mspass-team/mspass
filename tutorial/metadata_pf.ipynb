    "MsPASS makes extensive use of a C++ object we call Metadata.  A Metadata object is one of a many options we could have used to define the generalization of the idea of a header familar to many seismologists.  Headers are used, for example, in SAC and all seismic reflection packages we are aware of.   A \"header\", however, can be thought of as a implementation detail for a more general concept:  fetching parameters with a name-value pair relationship.  We use Metadata in preference to a python dict because the implementation is cleaner at the C++ level.  It is also, in principle, faster since the same methods visible through python wrapper are accesible in C++ code.   The purpose of this tutorial is to give users familiarity of this core class used for a wide variety of purposes.  \n",

    "The general problem of data types with attributes like those we extract from Metadata has two end members in the computing world:  (1) python, which is completely agnostic about type, and (2) strongly typed languages like C/C++ and FORTRAN.  Since MsPASS is a hybrid with C++ implementation of some compute intensive, core algorithms and python for higher level processing this clash in concept has to be handled. An additional constraint comes from the use of MongoDB or any database engine.  Chaos will reign if a name key is used for attributes of different types; a problem far too easy to create even accidentally with python. Since the main purpose of MsPASS is to provide a framework for handling long-running, compute intensive data processing jobs, we have to enforce some type restrictions on attributes to avoid mysterious downstream behaviour and bugs that are difficult to impossible to find.  We do this through a core mspass object we call MetadataDefinitions.

    "The *AntelopePf* is an implementation of a different, but related problem in all data processing.  Almost any algorithm has at least one tunable parameter that needs to be defined.  In general, the more generic an algorithm is the more parameters will be needed to define the way it should behave.  In the early days of data processing this problem was often solved by creating special format \"input files\" that a program read at startup.   Computer scientists realized decades ago that this was a generic problem and thus had generic solutions.   Hundreds of solutions to this problem exist with configuration files of various formats.  Today the most common is probably xml. We elected to no use xml for our initial development of mspass for two reasons:\n",
    "1.  xml is not a human readable format, but a language for robots (computers).  It is very hard for a human being to create a valid xml file by entering the data manually.  We needed a format that was easy for a human to construct.\n",
    "2.  Many seismologists utilize BRTT's \"parameter files\", because of the generous license agreement BRTT provides for U.S. scientists.   Furthermore, both of primary authors of MsPASS were familiar with parameter files and we had an open source implementation we could build on from Pavlis's plane wave migration code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus adopted the \"parameter files\" syntax to implement an extension of Metadata we call an *AntelopePf*. The *AntelopePf* is a child of *Metadata* so the same methods introduced for *Metadata* can be used for an *AntelopePf*.   The use, however, is more than a little subtle and is best understood from an example.  "
