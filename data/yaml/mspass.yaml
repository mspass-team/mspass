# Notes on the format of this master configuration file
# Multiple groups of attributes can be defined in indented sections.  The
# top level master is Attributes.  Exensions should be added in groups with
# appropriate names.  All will be parsed.
#
# All real number values should have type: set to double because python float
# today is always a 64 bit entity which to C++ is a double
#
# For each entry these keys are required:  name, type, and concept.
# If aliases is missing it means tehre are none.  You can also just have no entry after the keyword
# readonly is a boolean.  If is present it will be taken as true unless explicitly marked false
#   Hence, normally just omit this for atributes that are to be automatically written
#   and updated.
# unique_id and table are required ONLY if readonly is true.   These are used to
#   reference what MongoDB calls the normalized data model.  This feature is used
#   attributes that are stable, stored in one place (table), and readonly.
#   unique_id is a key to access data in table (a document in mongodb).  See
#   documentation for a full description of the concepts
Attributes:
# These are required attributes in an obspy trace object.  We keep them here
# to make that clear
